He is the source of the divine life, the One of whom we have been born with this life.

BD["e)/\x99"]="<b>blood</b><br> &emsp; When we live in the divine light, we are under its enlightenment, and it exposes, according to God&rsquo;s divine nature and through God&rsquo;s nature in us, all our sins, trespasses, failures, and defects, which contradict His pure light, perfect love, absolute holiness, and excelling righteousness. At such a time we sense in our enlightened conscience the need of the cleansing of the redeeming blood of the Lord Jesus, and it cleanses us in our conscience from all sins that our fellowship with God and with one another may be maintained. Our relationship with God is unbreakable, yet our fellowship with Him can be interrupted. The former is of life, whereas the latter is based on our living, though it also is of life. One is unconditional; the other is conditional. Our fellowship, which is conditional, needs to be maintained by the constant cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood.<br> &emsp; In this section of the Word there is a cycle in our spiritual life, a cycle formed of four crucial things&mdash;the eternal life, the fellowship of the eternal life, the divine light, and the blood of Jesus the Son of God. Eternal life issues in its fellowship, the fellowship of eternal life brings in the divine light, and the divine light increases the need for the blood of Jesus the Son of God that we may have more eternal life. The more we have of eternal life, the more of its fellowship it brings to us. The more fellowship of the divine life we enjoy, the more divine light we receive. The more divine light we receive, the more we participate in the cleansing of the blood of Jesus. Such a cycle brings us onward in the growth of the divine life until we reach the maturity of life."

God, Christ, and the Spirit&mdash;the Divine Trinity&mdash;are essentially one. Hence, these three, being the basic elements of the substance of the divine reality, are actually one reality. This one divine reality is the substance of the Word of God as the divine revelation. Hence, it becomes the revealed divine reality in the divine Word and makes the divine Word the reality. The divine Word conveys this one divine reality as the contents of the faith, and the contents of the faith are the substance of the gospel revealed in the entire New Testament as its reality, which is just the divine reality of the Divine Trinity. When this divine reality is partaken of and enjoyed by us, it becomes our genuineness, sincerity, honesty, and trustworthiness as an excellent virtue in our behavior that enables us to express God, the God of reality, by whom we live; and we become persons living a life of truth, without any falsehood or hypocrisy, a life that corresponds with the truth revealed through creation and the Scripture.<br> &emsp; The word truth is used in the New Testament more than one hundred times. Its denotation in each occurrence is determined by its context. For instance, in <a href=Joh.htm#v3_21>John 3:21</a>, according to the context, it denotes uprightness (the opposite of evil&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v3_19>John 3:19</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_20>20</a>), which is the reality manifested in a man who lives in God according to what He is and which corresponds with the divine light, which is God, as the source of the truth, manifested in Christ. In <a href=Joh.htm#v4_23>John 4:23</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v4_24>24</a>, according to the context of that chapter and also according to the entire revelation of John&rsquo;s Gospel, it denotes the divine reality becoming man&rsquo;s genuineness and sincerity (the opposite of the hypocrisy of the immoral Samaritan worshipper&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v4_16>John 4:16</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v4_18>18</a>) for the true worship of God. The divine reality is Christ, who is the reality (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_6>John 14:6</a>), as the reality of all the offerings of the Old Testament for the worship of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>John 1:29</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_14>3:14</a>) and as the fountain of living water, the life-giving Spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_7>John 4:7</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v4_15>15</a>), partaken of and drunk by His believers to be the reality within them, which eventually becomes their genuineness and sincerity, in which they worship God with the worship that He seeks. In <a href=Joh.htm#v5_33>John 5:33</a> and <a href=Joh.htm#v18_37>18:37</a>, according to the entire revelation of the Gospel of John, truth denotes the divine reality embodied, revealed, and expressed in Christ as the Son of God. In <a href=Joh.htm#v8_32>John 8:32</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v8_40>40</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v8_44>44</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v8_46>46</a>, according to the context of that chapter, it denotes the reality of God revealed in His word (<a href=Joh.htm#v8_47>John 8:47</a>) and embodied in Christ, the Son of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v8_36>John 8:36</a>), which sets us free from the bondage of sin (see <a href=JohN.htm#n8_32x1>note 32<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Joh.htm#v8>John 8</a>).<br> &emsp; Here in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_6>v. 6</a>, truth denotes the revealed reality of God in its aspect of the divine light. It is the issue and realization of the divine light mentioned in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_5>v. 5</a>. The divine light is the source in God; truth is the issue and realization of the divine light in us (see <a href=1JoN.htm#n4_8x2>note 8<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=1Jo.htm#v4>ch. 4</a>; cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v3_19>John 3:19</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_21>21</a>). When we abide in the divine light, which we enjoy in the fellowship of the divine life, we practice the truth&mdash;what we have realized in the divine light. When we abide in the source, its issue becomes our practice."
