BD["U)F\x98"]="<b>righteousness</b><br> &emsp; Christ became wisdom to us from God as three vital things in God&rsquo;s salvation: (1) righteousness (for our past), by which we have been justified by God, that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_18>Rom. 5:18</a>); (2) sanctification (for our present), by which we are being sanctified in our soul, i.e., transformed in our mind, emotion, and will, with His divine life (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_19>Rom. 6:19</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v6_22>22</a>); and (3) redemption (for our future), i.e., the redemption of our body (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_23>Rom. 8:23</a>), by which we will be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His glorious likeness (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_21>Phil. 3:21</a>). It is of God that we participate in such a complete and perfect salvation, which makes our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;organically one with Christ and makes Christ everything to us. This is altogether of God, not of ourselves, that we may boast and glory in Him, not in ourselves."

BD["*6U\x97"]="<b>break</b><br> &emsp; The breaking down of the house after the infection of leprosy returns signifies that if the situation of a church reaches the point where it cannot be cured, healed, that church should be terminated (cf. <a href=Rev.htm#v2_5>Rev. 2:5</a>)."
BD["*5X\x97"]="<b>warp</b><br> &emsp; The warp in the weave of a garment goes from top to bottom, and the woof, from left to right. Thus, the warp signifies our outward conduct toward God, our relationship with God, and the woof signifies our outward conduct toward others. Our conduct in our daily walk is an interweaving that involves both God and man. We need to be proper with both God and man; i.e., in our garments, our conduct, there should be no leprosy, rebellion, either in the warp or in the woof, either toward God or toward man."

BD["R4\@\x98"]="<b>much</b><br> &emsp; This &ldquo;much fruit&rdquo; became Christ&rsquo;s increase in resurrection. This increase is the glory into which Christ entered through His death and resurrection (<a href=Luk.htm#v24_26>Luke 24:26</a>). The portion from <a href=Joh.htm#v12_23>v. 23</a> of this chapter to the end of <a href=Joh.htm#v17>ch. 17</a> is a discourse on the mystery of this glory. Christ had the glory with God (<a href=Joh.htm#v17_5>17:5</a>). His incarnation caused His divine glory to be concealed in His flesh. Through His death and resurrection His glory was released, producing many grains, which become His increase as the expression of His glory. What was spoken in vv. <a href=Joh.htm#v12_23>23</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v12_28>28</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v13_31>13:31</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v13_32>32</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v14_13>14:13</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v15_8>15:8</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v16_14>16:14</a>; and <a href=Joh.htm#v17_1>17:1</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v17_4>4</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v17_5>5</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v17_10>10</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v17_22>22</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v17_24>24</a> is related to this glory. In the Lord&rsquo;s last words to the believers in chs. <a href=Joh.htm#v14>14</a>&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v16>16</a>, there are three concrete, corporate expressions of this glory: the Father&rsquo;s house (the church) in <a href=Joh.htm#v14_2>14:2</a>, the branches of the vine (the constituents of the Body of Christ) in <a href=Joh.htm#v15_1>15:1</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v15_5>5</a>, and a newborn corporate man (the new man) in <a href=Joh.htm#v16_21>16:21</a>. All three denote the church, showing that the church is the glorious increase produced by the glorious Christ through His death and resurrection. In this glorious increase, Christ, the Son of God, is glorified, causing God the Father also to be glorified in Christ&rsquo;s glorification, that is, to be fully expressed through the church (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_19>Eph. 3:19</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v3_21>21</a>). This expression needs to be maintained in the oneness of the Triune God. Therefore, the Lord prayed in particular for this matter in His concluding prayer in <a href=Joh.htm#v17>ch. 17</a> (<a href=Joh.htm#v17_20>17:20</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v17_23>23</a>). This glorious increase of Christ is the peak of the mystery revealed in the Gospel of John, and its ultimate consummation is the New Jerusalem in Revelation, also written by John. The new holy city will be the aggregate of Christ&rsquo;s increase throughout the generations, and in it Christ&rsquo;s divine glory will be expressed to the uttermost. In the glorifying of God the Son, God the Father also will obtain eternal, matchless glory, which will be His full expression in eternity. Thus His eternal economy will be fulfilled for eternity."
