BD["c*-\x9a"]="<b>house</b><br> &emsp; God&rsquo;s goal in the believers is to have a house built up with living stones&mdash;not separated and scattered stones, nor even stones merely gathered and piled up together, but stones built up one with another."
BD["b):\x97"]="<b>brought</b><br> &emsp; Sin, the source of darkness, brings forth death (<a href=Jam.htm#v1_15>v. 15</a>). But the Father of lights brought us forth to be the firstfruits of His creatures, full of the vigorous life that matures first. This refers to the divine birth, our regeneration (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_5>John 3:5</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v3_6>6</a>), which is carried out according to God&rsquo;s eternal purpose."
BD["c)1\x97"]="<b>Receiving</b><br> &emsp; According to grammar, this word continues <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_8>v. 8</a>, but according to fact, it is connected with <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_7>v. 7</a>. The proving of our faith being found unto praise, glory, and honor results in the receiving of the end of our faith, that is, the salvation of our souls."
BD["=,0\x99"]="<b>Amana</b><br> &emsp; Meaning truth. The truth refers to the reality of the consummated Triune God, the all-inclusive Christ with His complete redemption, and the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving, sevenfold intensified Spirit. These realities are the three of the Triune God. Cf. <a href=1JoN.htm#n1_6x6>note 6<sup>6</sup></a> in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1>1&nbsp;John 1</a>."
BD["c)0\x9a"]="<b>joy</b><br> &emsp; Joy full of glory is joy immersed in glory; hence, joy that is full of the Lord expressed."
BD["b-.\x97"]="<b>righteous</b><br> &emsp; The collective singular, with the article used to indicate the class. It does not refer directly to any individual but portrays the death of the Lord Jesus, who is the Righteous (<a href=Act.htm#v7_52>Acts 7:52</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v3_14>3:14</a>)."
BD["=+3\x99"]="<b>espousals</b><br> &emsp; Christ&rsquo;s espousal and marriage life cover the church age, the kingdom age, and the eternal age. Christ&rsquo;s espousals began from the time of incarnation, when incarnation as His mother crowned Him with His humanity, and continue through the church age, an age of warfare (vv. <a href=SoS.htm#v3_7>7</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v3_8>8</a>), in which all His believers are espoused to Him as virgins (<a href=2Co.htm#v11_2>2&nbsp;Cor. 11:2</a>). After the church age, in the kingdom age Christ&rsquo;s regenerated and transformed wife, composed of the overcoming believers, becomes a palanquin to Him for His triumphant celebration (vv. <a href=SoS.htm#v3_9>9</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v3_10>10</a>). The celebration of Christ&rsquo;s victory is His thousand-year wedding day (<a href=Rev.htm#v19_7>Rev. 19:7</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v19_8>8</a>). His marriage life after His wedding will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_9>Rev. 21:9</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_10>10</a>).<br> &emsp; The union of the bed with its sleeper (vv. <a href=SoS.htm#v3_7>7</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v3_8>8</a>), the union of the palanquin with its rider (vv. <a href=SoS.htm#v3_9>9</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v3_10>10</a>), and the union of the bride with her bridegroom (<a href=SoS.htm#v3_11>v. 11</a>) all signify the complete union of the lover with Christ, which has made her God&rsquo;s new creation in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:17</a>). The bed in the night, the palanquin in the day, and the marriage life in the ages to come all refer to the one lover of Christ&mdash;the Shulammite (<a href=SoS.htm#v6_13>6:13</a> and <a href=SoSN.htm#n6_13x1>note 1</a>). Eventually, the New Jerusalem will be a corporate Shulammite, which will include all God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_9>Rev. 21:9</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_10>10</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_12>12</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_14>14</a>)."
BD["b,1\x97"]="<b>Endure</b><br> &emsp; This verse is a solemn admonition to God&rsquo;s adulterous spouse, who indulges herself in fleshly pleasures by loving the world under the usurpation of the devil."
BD["a0.\x97"]="<b>ministry</b><br> &emsp; Referring to the ministry of a priest; derived from the same Greek word as minister in <a href=Heb.htm#v8_2>v. 2</a>."
BD["b+4\x97"]="<b>salt</b><br> &emsp; In vv. <a href=Jam.htm#v3_3>3</a>-<a href=Jam.htm#v3_12>12</a>, in dealing with the problem of the tongue, James, in his wisdom concerning human life, used twenty different items as illustrations: bridles of horses, rudders of ships, a wildfire, the world of unrighteousness, fire from Gehenna, the wheel of birth, beasts, birds, reptiles, creatures of the sea, the human nature, a restless evil, a deadly poison, a spring, a fig tree, olives, a vine, figs, salt (bitter) water, and sweet water. James was rich in wisdom concerning human life, somewhat like Solomon, the wise king of the Old Testament (<a href=1Ki.htm#v4_29>1&nbsp;Kings 4:29</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v4_34>34</a>), but not so in wisdom concerning the divine economy. See <a href=JamN.htm#n1_11x1>note 11<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Jam.htm#v1>ch. 1</a>."
BD["c++\x97"]="<b>plaiting</b><br> &emsp; Women&rsquo;s hair is intended by God for their glory and as a sign of their submission (<a href=1Co.htm#v11_15>1&nbsp;Cor. 11:15</a>; <a href=SoS.htm#v4_1>S.S. 4:1</a>; <a href=SoS.htm#v6_5>6:5</a>; <a href=SoS.htm#v7_5>7:5</a>). But it was misused by many, especially by those who lived in the luxurious and corrupt life of the Roman Empire at the time of this Epistle, to beautify their lustful flesh by adorning it extravagantly with gold and other costly things. Christian wives, as holy women, should absolutely abstain from this God-condemned practice."
BD["a/1\x97"]="<b>Levi</b><br> &emsp; This corresponds with the fact that all the human race sinned in Adam, since all the human race was in the loins of Adam when he sinned (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_12>Rom. 5:12</a>)."
BD["b*7\x97"]="<b>is</b><br> &emsp; The verb indicates that they have been in this condition for some time."
