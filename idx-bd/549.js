BD["H-*\x97"]="<b>come</b><br> &emsp; This verse prophesies concerning the incarnation of Christ in Bethlehem (<a href=Mat.htm#v2_4>Matt. 2:4</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v2_6>6</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v2_4>Luke 2:4</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v2_7>7</a>). Although Christ came forth from Bethlehem, His goings forth were from ancient times, from the days of eternity. This refers to Christ&rsquo;s eternal origin and indicates that in eternity, before the creation of the earth, Christ was preparing to come forth. Christ&rsquo;s appearing, His manifestation, began in eternity. From ancient times, from the days of eternity, the Triune God was preparing to come forth out of eternity into time, to come with His divinity into humanity by being born in Bethlehem as a man. His creating of all things was His preparation for Him to come out of eternity into time. This was the purpose of creation. Then, while the &ldquo;locusts&rdquo; were operating to consume Israel (<a href=Joe.htm#v1_4>Joel 1:4</a>; <a href=Joe.htm#v2_25>2:25</a>), Christ came forth.<br> &emsp; Christ&rsquo;s going forth, His appearing, is a continuous matter. At the time of His incarnation He began to come forth. After His incarnation, He continued to go forth through His human living, His death, His resurrection, His ascension, His outpouring of the consummated Spirit (who is the reality of Christ Himself), and His spreading through the preaching of the gospel to the whole inhabited earth. All these are great steps in Christ&rsquo;s going forth. His going forth has not ceased but is continuing today. Christ&rsquo;s going forth, His manifestation, will consummate when He comes back with the overcomers as the mighty ones (<a href=Joe.htm#v3_11>Joel 3:11</a>) to defeat Antichrist and cast him into the lake of fire (<a href=Rev.htm#v19_19>Rev. 19:19</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v19_20>20</a>), when Satan is cast into the abyss (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_2>Rev. 20:2</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_3>3</a>), and when Christ sets up His throne to reign as King (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_31>Matt. 25:31</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v25_34>34</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v25_40>40</a>). At that time His appearing will be complete.<br> &emsp; While Christ is on the way, He is taking care of the scattered Jews. On the one hand, Israel is under God&rsquo;s chastisement; on the other hand, Israel is also under God&rsquo;s shepherding care. This shepherding is God&rsquo;s preservation of Israel."
