This indicates that this Epistle was written to the Jewish Christians, who had the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory (<a href=Jam.htm#v2_1>2:1</a>) and were justified by faith (<a href=Jam.htm#v2_24>2:24</a>), regenerated by the word of truth (<a href=Jam.htm#v1_18>v. 18</a>), and indwelt by the Spirit of God (<a href=Jam.htm#v4_5>4:5</a>), and who were members of the church (<a href=Jam.htm#v5_14>5:14</a>), awaiting the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (<a href=Jam.htm#v5_7>5:7</a>-<a href=Jam.htm#v5_8>8</a>). However, for the writer to call these believers in Christ &ldquo;the twelve tribes,&rdquo; as God&rsquo;s chosen people were called in His Old Testament economy, indicates that he lacked a clear view concerning the distinction between Christians and Jews, between God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and the Old Testament dispensation. Apparently, he did not see that in the New Testament God had delivered and separated the Jewish believers in Christ from the Jewish people, who were then considered by God a perverse generation (<a href=Act.htm#v2_40>Acts 2:40</a>). In His New Testament economy, God does not consider the Jewish believers to be Jews set apart for Judaism but Christians set apart for the church. As members of the church of God, they should be as distinct and separate from the Jews as they are from the Gentiles (<a href=1Co.htm#v10_32>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:32</a>). Yet James, a pillar of the church, in his Epistle to the Christian brothers still called them &ldquo;the twelve tribes.&rdquo; (This might have been the reason that he addressed the word in <a href=Jam.htm#v5_1>5:1</a>-<a href=Jam.htm#v5_6>6</a> to the rich class in general among the Jews.) This was contrary to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. See <a href=JamN.htm#n2_2x1>note 2<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Jam.htm#v2>ch. 2</a>."
