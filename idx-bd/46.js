In both physical life and spiritual life eating and drinking should always go together. At the beginning of the Bible, the tree of life and the manna are mentioned before the water of life (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>Gen. 2:9</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_10>10</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v16_4>Exo. 16:4</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v16_14>14</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v16_15>15</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v17_6>17:6</a>; cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v6_31>John 6:31</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v6_35>35</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v7_37>7:37</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v7_39>39</a>), indicating that in the beginning of our spiritual life our eating of Christ in His word (<a href=Jer.htm#v15_16>Jer. 15:16</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v4_4>Matt. 4:4</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v6_63>John 6:63</a>) issues in the flowing of the Spirit as the living water within us. However, at the end of the Bible the river of water of life is mentioned before the tree of life (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>Rev. 22:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v22_2>2</a>), and the tree of life grows in (i.e., is conveyed in) the river, indicating that as we progress in spiritual experience, the Spirit as the flowing river brings us the supply of the word, the manna. This implies that ultimately in the divine concept eating is included in drinking and drinking is more important than eating.<br> &emsp; In the Bible the basic principle concerning man&rsquo;s relationship with God is that man needs to eat and drink of God. It is by eating and drinking that we, God&rsquo;s chosen people, take God into us, and it is through our eating and drinking Him that God works Himself into us to be one with us organically."
