In relation to the instant speaking of the Lord, all the believers in Christ, including the elders, are priests to God (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v1_6>Rev. 1:6</a>), having Christ as the High Priest living within them (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_1>Heb. 8:1</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_10>Rom. 8:10</a>) and having the Holy Spirit mingled with their regenerated human spirit (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_16>Rom. 8:16</a>) to replace the function of the Urim and Thummim.

BD[".6.\x97"]="<b>tore</b><br> &emsp; Samson had faith in God (cf. <a href=Heb.htm#v11_32>Heb. 11:32</a>). His faith is seen in his tearing a young lion by the Spirit of Jehovah rushing upon him (vv. <a href=Jdg.htm#v14_5>5</a>-<a href=Jdg.htm#v14_6>6</a>), in his slaying thirty men by the Spirit of Jehovah rushing upon him (<a href=Jdg.htm#v14_19>v. 19</a>), in his slaying one thousand Philistines by the Spirit of Jehovah rushing upon him (<a href=Jdg.htm#v15_12>15:12</a>-<a href=Jdg.htm#v15_18>18a</a>), and in his destroying the house where he was compelled to perform (<a href=Jdg.htm#v16_28>16:28</a>-<a href=Jdg.htm#v16_30>30</a>)."

BD[")B7\x97"]="<b>boards</b><br> &emsp; The walls of the tabernacle, composed of standing boards, typify the believers built together to be the dwelling place of God (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>Eph. 2:22</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5</a>). Thus, the church, the corporate Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_12>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:12</a>), is included with the individual Christ in the type of the tabernacle (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n25_9x2>note 9<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v25>ch. 25</a>). In the picture of the tabernacle the corporate Christ is covered by the individual Christ (cf. <a href=2Co.htm#v12_9>2&nbsp;Cor. 12:9</a>). The fact that the covering of the tabernacle is revealed in Exodus before the boards indicates that Christ&rsquo;s redemption had to take place before the church could come into existence."

Thus, the cherubim on the expiation cover indicate that Christ expresses God&rsquo;s glory (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>). They were made of beaten work, indicating that Christ&rsquo;s expressing of the divine glory was through sufferings (cf. <a href=Heb.htm#v2_9>Heb. 2:9</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v2_10>10</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_17>Rom. 8:17</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_18>18</a>)."
