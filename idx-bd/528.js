Nathanael recognized Him as the Son of God and addressed Him as such (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_49>v. 49</a>), but Christ said to Nathanael that He was the Son of Man. The Son of God is God; as such, He has the divine nature. The Son of Man is man; as such, He possesses the human nature. For the declaring of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_18>v. 18</a>) and for the bringing of God to man, He is the only begotten Son of God. But for the building of God&rsquo;s habitation on earth among men, He is the Son of Man. God&rsquo;s building needs His humanity.
