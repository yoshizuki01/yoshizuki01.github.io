BD["Q7?\x97"]="<b>fattened</b><br> &emsp; Signifying the rich Christ (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_8>Eph. 3:8</a>), killed on the cross for the believer&rsquo;s enjoyment. God&rsquo;s salvation has two aspects: the outward, objective aspect, signified by the best robe, and the inward, subjective aspect, signified by the fattened calf. Christ as our righteousness is our salvation outwardly; Christ as our life for our enjoyment is our salvation inwardly. The best robe enabled the prodigal son to meet his father&rsquo;s requirements and satisfy his father, and the fattened calf satisfied the son&rsquo;s hunger. Hence, the father and the son could be merry together."
BD["O\@6\x97"]="<b>gospel</b><br> &emsp; The gospel of the kingdom, which includes the gospel of grace (<a href=Act.htm#v20_24>Acts 20:24</a>), brings people not only into God&rsquo;s salvation but also into the kingdom of the heavens (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_9>Rev. 1:9</a>). The gospel of grace emphasizes forgiveness of sin, God&rsquo;s redemption, and eternal life, whereas the gospel of the kingdom emphasizes the heavenly ruling of God and the authority of the Lord. This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole earth for a testimony to all the nations before the end of this age. Hence, that preaching, signified by the white horse of the first seal in <a href=Rev.htm#v6_1>Rev. 6:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v6_2>2</a>, will be a sign of the consummation of this age."

BD["V*9\x97"]="<b>adulterating</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means retailing, hawking. Originally, it referred to the selling of inferior items at high prices in a tricky way by peddlers who were of low class. Many engaged in this kind of hawking, adulterating the word of God for their profit, but the apostles did not. Out of sincerity and out of God in their ministry, they spoke in Christ the word of God in the sight of God. How sincere and genuine were the apostles in their ministry!"
BD["P1Z\x97"]="<b>Salt</b><br> &emsp; See <a href=MatN.htm#n5_13x2>note 13<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v5>Matt. 5</a>. The application of the word here differs from that in <a href=Mat.htm#v5_13>Matt. 5:13</a> and <a href=Luk.htm#v14_34>Luke 14:34</a>. In Matthew and Luke, salt, portraying the believers&rsquo; influence on the world, is for the salting of the corrupted world; salt here, in apposition to the purging fire, is for the salting of sinning believers, even as God&rsquo;s chastisements are for the sinning believers in this age. Hence, the believers should have salt in themselves that they may be purified not only from sins but also from any divisive element (such as was displayed by the impetuous John in forbidding a differing brother and in arguing for greatness) and may thus be at peace with one another. Such purging salt purges the believers&rsquo; speech that they may keep peace with one another (<a href=Col.htm#v4_6>Col. 4:6</a>). The Lord&rsquo;s word here indicates that John&rsquo;s speech to the brother who differed from him had not been purged. Thus, the entire section, vv. <a href=Mrk.htm#v9_38>38</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v9_50>50</a>, presents the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s teaching concerning the believers&rsquo; being tolerant for the sake of unity."

To receive salvation is to be saved (<a href=Luk.htm#v13_23>13:23</a>); to follow the Lord is to enjoy Him as the blessing of God&rsquo;s salvation. This requires us to renounce all, even our life, and to carry our own cross (vv. <a href=Luk.htm#v14_26>26</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v14_27>27</a>, <a href=Luk.htm#v14_33>33</a>)."

The Lord&rsquo;s promise here is different from the promise of the Father concerning the Spirit of power in <a href=Luk.htm#v24_49>Luke 24:49</a>. That promise was fulfilled fifty days after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, on the day of Pentecost, when the Spirit as the mighty wind blew upon the disciples (<a href=Act.htm#v2_1>Acts 2:1</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v2_4>4</a>). In this verse the Spirit of life is called &ldquo;the Spirit of reality.&rdquo; This Spirit of reality is Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_6>v. 6</a>); hence, the Spirit of reality is the Spirit of Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_9>Rom. 8:9</a>). This Spirit is also the reality of Christ (<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_6>1&nbsp;John 5:6</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_20>20</a>) that Christ may be realized in those who believe into Him, as their life and life supply."
