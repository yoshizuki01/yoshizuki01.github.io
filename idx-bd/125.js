The outcome of the casting of lots was according to what God had foreordained. For example, according to God&rsquo;s ordination, Jerusalem and the surrounding district were for Judah (<a href=Jos.htm#v15_63>15:63</a>), out of whom Christ would come (<a href=Mic.htm#v5_2>Micah 5:2</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v7_14>Heb. 7:14</a>). Nevertheless, this still had to be realized by the casting of lots. God&rsquo;s ordaining hand was present in the casting of lots to direct the result (<a href=Prv.htm#v16_33>Prov. 16:33</a>). Thus, the dividing of the land did not depend on Joshua or on the high priest but only on God. As a result, there was no ground for the tribes to complain about the portion of the land allotted to them. The way of allotting the land was fair, and it caused everyone to be subdued."

Cf. <a href=Heb.htm#v3_7>Heb. 3:7</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v3_19>19</a>. God forgave the sinning Israelites yet still punished them. This shows that God&rsquo;s forgiveness is of different kinds. One kind is forgiveness through punishment. Cf. notes <a href=MatN.htm#n12_32x2>32<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v12>Matt. 12</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n18_34x1>34<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v18>Matt. 18</a>."

This word was a great prophecy uttered by Moses. It was promoted by Paul in <a href=1Co.htm#v14>1&nbsp;Cor. 14</a> and is fulfilled in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy by the prophesying of the believers in the church meetings (<a href=1Co.htm#v14_24>1&nbsp;Cor. 14:24</a>, <a href=1Co.htm#v14_31>31</a>)."
BD["Q*[\x8c"]="And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And His mother carefully kept all these things in her heart."

BD["S4+\x8c"]="And when he saw that it was pleasing to the Jews, he went on to arrest Peter also (now <I>those</I> were the days of Unleavened Bread),"
BD["R.F\x8c"]="They said then to Him, What sign then will You do that we may see and believe You? What work will You do?"
BD["S3.\x8c"]="Looking intently into it, I examined <I>it</I> and saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the reptiles and the birds of heaven."
BD["R-I\x8c"]="You have sent <I>people</I> to John, and he has testified to the truth."

BD[",49\x97"]="<b>eat</b><br> &emsp; The children of Israel could enjoy the rich produce of the good land in two ways. The common, private way was to enjoy it as a common portion at any time, in any place, and with anyone (<a href=Deu.htm#v12_15>v. 15</a>). The special, corporate way was to enjoy the top portion, the firstfruits and the firstlings, with all the Israelites at the appointed feasts and in the unique place chosen by God (see <a href=DeuN.htm#n12_5x1>note 5<sup>1</sup></a>). Likewise, the enjoyment of Christ by the New Testament believers is of two aspects&mdash;the common, private aspect of enjoying Christ at any time and at any place, and the special, corporate aspect of enjoying the top portion of Christ in the meetings of the proper church life on the unique ground of oneness, the place chosen by God."

Here the cherubim embroidered on the linen curtains signify God&rsquo;s glory manifested in Jesus as a man, a creature (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v1_15>Col. 1:15</a>). That the number of the cherubim is not given indicates that God&rsquo;s glory manifested in His creature is immeasurable (cf. notes <a href=ExoN.htm#n25_19x1>19<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=ExoN.htm#n25_39x1>39<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v25>ch. 25</a>)."
