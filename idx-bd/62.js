BD["X-A\x97"]="<b>love</b><br> &emsp; The opposite of being subject is to rule; however, the apostle did not exhort husbands to rule over their wives but to love them. In married life, the wife&rsquo;s obligation is to be subject and the husband&rsquo;s is to love. The wife&rsquo;s subjection plus the husband&rsquo;s love constitutes a proper married life and typifies the normal church life, in which the church is subject to Christ and Christ loves the church. Love is the very element, the inner substance, of God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v4_8>1&nbsp;John 4:8</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v4_16>16</a>). The goal of this book is to bring us into God&rsquo;s inner substance that we may enjoy God as love and enjoy His presence in the sweetness of the divine love, and thereby love others as Christ did."

This governs, holds, and keeps our Christian life for the church life."
