The trouble and persecution caused by Satan can make the highway a valley of weeping. This special term indicates that the psalmist had been disciplined by God and had been stripped by Him (see notes <a href=PsaN.htm#n73_26x1>26<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Psa.htm#v73>Psa. 73</a> and <a href=JobN.htm#n3_1x1>1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Job.htm#v3>Job 3</a>)."

Here it refers to walking in the steps by observing the elements of the faith.

To lose the soul-life is to cause the soul to lose its enjoyment and thereby to suffer. If the heavenly King&rsquo;s followers allow their soul to have its enjoyment in this age, they will cause their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age. If they allow their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in this age for the King&rsquo;s sake, they will enable their soul to have its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age, that is, to share the King&rsquo;s joy in ruling over the earth (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_21>25:21</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v25_23>23</a>)."
BD["U+.\x97"]="<b>planted</b><br> &emsp; To plant, to water, and to cause to grow are all related to the matter of life. This indicates that the believers are God&rsquo;s cultivated land (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_9>v. 9</a>) to grow Christ. The ministers of Christ can only plant and water. Only God can cause the growth. The Corinthian believers overesteemed the planter and the waterer and neglected the One who causes the growth. Hence, they did not grow in Christ as their life.<br> &emsp; The Corinthian believers, under the prevailing influence of Greek philosophical wisdom, paid too much attention to knowledge, neglecting life. In this chapter Paul&rsquo;s intention was to turn their attention from knowledge to life, pointing out that to them he was a feeder and a planter; Apollos, a waterer; and God, the One who causes the growth. In <a href=1Co.htm#v4_15>4:15</a> he even told them that he was their spiritual father, who begot them in Christ through the gospel. From the view of life, the divine view, they were God&rsquo;s cultivated land to grow Christ. This was entirely a matter of life, a matter utterly missed by believers who are dominated by their soulish, natural life under the influence of their natural wisdom."

Unless a member of His Body had been sent by the Lord to contact him, it would have been difficult for any member of the Body to receive Saul (cf. <a href=Act.htm#v9_26>v. 26</a>).
