The new creation is only that which is in ascension in resurrection. Anyone who is in Christ and in His resurrection is a new creation (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:17</a>). The matters of resurrection and the new creation are closely related to Christ&rsquo;s ascension. Actually, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension are one (cf. <a href=Eph.htm#v2_5>Eph. 2:5</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_6>6</a>). If we are in His resurrection, we are also in His ascension."

BD["a,8\x98"]="<b>mercy</b><br> &emsp; Both God&rsquo;s mercy and God&rsquo;s grace are the expression of His love. When we are in a pitiful condition, first God&rsquo;s mercy reaches us and brings us into a situation in which He is able to favor us with His grace. <a href=Luk.htm#v15_20>Luke 15:20</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v15_24>24</a> tells us that when the father saw the prodigal son returning, he had compassion on him. That was mercy, which expressed the father&rsquo;s love. Then the father clothed him with the best robe and fed him with the fattened calf. That was grace, which again manifested the father&rsquo;s love. God&rsquo;s mercy reaches farther and bridges the gap between us and God&rsquo;s grace.<br> &emsp; God&rsquo;s mercy and grace are always available to us. However, we need to receive and find them by exercising our spirit to come to the throne of grace and contact our High Priest, who is touched with the feeling of all our weaknesses. By this word the writer of this book encouraged the wearied Hebrew believers to receive mercy and find grace for timely help, that they might be set upright (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_12>12:12</a>)."
BD["=*5\x97"]="<b>Rise</b><br> &emsp; This repeated word (cf. <a href=SoS.htm#v2_10>v. 10</a>) indicates Christ&rsquo;s eagerness in asking His lover to come away from her introspection of the self to be with Him. See <a href=SoSN.htm#n2_10x2>note 10<sup>2</sup></a>."

Further, she is satisfied with her rest in Christ&rsquo;s death (cypresses) and His resurrection (cedars) as the shelter (beams and rafters&mdash;<a href=SoS.htm#v1_17>v. 17</a>). The lover gains Christ and enjoys Him as her Husband (implied in the couch) in the divine life as the couch of green, in Christ in His resurrection as the beams, and in Christ in His death as the rafters for her shelter.
