BD["A)B\x97"]="<b>throne</b><br> &emsp; The four living creatures are not only for the manifestation of the Lord and not only for the move of the Lord but also for the administration, the government, of the Lord. The Lord is among them and above them for His manifestation, move, and government. In such a situation God is not only the God of heaven but also the God of the earth (see <a href=MatN.htm#n11_25x3>note 25<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v11>Matt. 11</a>). Through the living creatures the heavens are open to the earth and are joined to the earth.<br> &emsp; The Lord&rsquo;s presence is always with His throne. The Lord&rsquo;s throne is both in the third heaven and in our spirit (<a href=Rev.htm#v4_2>Rev. 4:2</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v4_3>3</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v4_16>Heb. 4:16</a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n4_16x1>note 1</a>; cf. <a href=2Ti.htm#v4_22>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:22</a>). The throne above the crystal clear expanse indicates that whenever we have a &ldquo;clear sky&rdquo; in our Christian life and in our church life, we will be under the ruling of the throne. The highest point in our spiritual experience is having a clear sky with a throne above it. To reach this point means that in everything we allow God to have the preeminence and are completely submissive to God&rsquo;s authority and administration. The throne is not only for God to reign over us but also for God to accomplish His eternal purpose. If we have the throne in our spiritual life, God will not only rule over us but will also fulfill His purpose in us, with us, and through us."
