To walk by the Spirit is to have our walk regulated by the Holy Spirit from within our spirit. This is in contrast to having our walk regulated by the law in the realm of our flesh. See <a href=GalN.htm#n3_3x2>note 3<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Gal.htm#v3>ch. 3</a>.<br> &emsp; The flesh is the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man (<a href=Gen.htm#v6_3>Gen. 6:3</a>), and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the processed Triune God (<a href=Joh.htm#v7_39>John 7:39</a>). Because of Christ&rsquo;s redemption and the Spirit&rsquo;s work of regeneration, we who have received God&rsquo;s dispensing can walk by the Spirit, by the processed Triune God, instead of by the flesh, by our fallen being. Paul wrote this book not only to rescue the distracted Galatian believers from the law, on the negative side, but also, on the positive side, to bring them into the realization that the believers have the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in their spirit that they may live, walk, and have their being in this Spirit."

BD["U45\x98"]="<b>one</b><br> &emsp; The believers of Christ are baptized through water and in the Spirit into (1) Christ, (2) the death of Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_3>Rom. 6:3</a>), (3) the name&mdash;the person&mdash;of the Triune God (<a href=Mat.htm#v28_19>Matt. 28:19</a>), and (4) the Body of Christ. Baptism ushers the believers into an organic union with Christ and the Triune God, making them living members of the Body of Christ. All the gifts, as the manifestation of the Spirit distributed to the individual believers by the Spirit, are for the profit, the building up, of this Body. The apostle was very conscious of this. He was Body-conscious, Body-centered, unlike the Corinthians and so many other believers through the centuries who are self-centered concerning spiritual gifts. Hence, after this verse he gave the Corinthians a long discourse concerning the Body. His intention was to rescue them from self-seeking back to a concern for the Body, that they might no longer be for their individual profit but for the building up of the Body."
