It is nobler than human love. It adorns all the qualities of the Christian life (<a href=1Co.htm#v13>1&nbsp;Cor. 13</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v13_8>Rom. 13:8</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v13_10>10</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v5_13>Gal. 5:13</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v5_14>14</a>). It is stronger in ability and greater in capacity than human love (<a href=Mat.htm#v5_44>Matt. 5:44</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v5_46>46</a>), yet a believer who lives by the divine life (<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_3>v. 3</a>) and partakes of the divine nature (<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_4>v. 4</a>) can be saturated with it and express it in full. Such a love needs to be developed in brotherly love to govern it and flow in it for the full expression of God, who is this love. Faith can be considered the seed of life, and this nobler love, the fruit (<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_8>v. 8</a>) in its full development. The six steps of development in between are the stages of its growth unto maturity."

No matter what the situation might be on earth and regardless of the corruption and degradation among God&rsquo;s people, Christ is still on the throne in His glory. The people had become fallen, but Christ and His throne remained the same in His glory. On this earth everything changes and fluctuates, but Christ remains the same today and forever (<a href=Heb.htm#v13_8>Heb. 13:8</a>).

BD["b)A\x98"]="<b>perfect</b><br> &emsp; Here James refers to the Mosaic law as &ldquo;the perfect law, the law of freedom (or liberty)&rdquo; (cf. <a href=Jam.htm#v2_12>2:12</a>). His use of this expression might have been based on <a href=Psa.htm#v19_7>Psa. 19:7</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v19_8>8</a>, which says that the law is perfect, that it restores the soul, i.e., gives people freedom, and that it makes the heart joyous, implying release and freedom, and on <a href=Psa.htm#v119_11>Psa. 119:11</a>, which says that keeping the law in our hearts frees us from sin. James uplifted the Old Testament law of letters to the uttermost, mixing God&rsquo;s New Testament economy with the outdated Old Testament economy (<a href=Act.htm#v21_18>Acts 21:18</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v21_20>20</a>). In his consideration the law was a primary means of Christian perfection. In contrast, the apostle Paul said that the law can do nothing to perfect us (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_19>Heb. 7:19</a>; cf. <a href=Gal.htm#v3_3>Gal. 3:3</a>). Cf. <a href=JamN.htm#n2_12x2>note 12<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Jam.htm#v2>ch. 2</a>.<br> &emsp; In God&rsquo;s New Testament dispensation Christ has ended the law (<a href=Rom.htm#v10_4>Rom. 10:4</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_9>Heb. 10:9</a>), and the believers have been freed by Christ from the yoke of slavery of the law (<a href=Gal.htm#v5_1>Gal. 5:1</a>), have died to the law (<a href=Gal.htm#v2_19>Gal. 2:19</a>), and are no longer under the law but under grace (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_14>Rom. 6:14</a>; cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v1_17>John 1:17</a>). Moreover, the law of letters written on tablets of stone outside us has been replaced by the law of life inscribed on our hearts (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_10>Heb. 8:10</a>), the moral standard of which corresponds with that of the kingdom&rsquo;s constitution, decreed by the Lord on the mount (<a href=Mat.htm#v5>Matt. 5</a>&mdash;<a href=Mat.htm#v7>7</a>). Since the law of letters was not able to give man life (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_21>Gal. 3:21</a>) but was able only to expose man&rsquo;s weakness and failure and keep him in slavery (<a href=Gal.htm#v5_1>Gal. 5:1</a> and <a href=GalN.htm#n5_1x4>note 4</a>), it was a law of bondage. Since the law of life is the function of the divine life, which was imparted into our being at regeneration and supplies us throughout our Christian life with the unsearchable riches of the divine life to free us from the law of sin and death and fulfill all the righteous requirements of the law of letters (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_2>Rom. 8:2</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v8_4>4</a>), it should be considered the law of freedom. This law is the law of Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v9_21>1&nbsp;Cor. 9:21</a>), even Christ Himself, who lives within us to regulate us by imparting the divine nature into our being, that we may live a life that expresses God&rsquo;s image. It is this law that should be considered the basic rule of the Christian life for practical Christian perfection."
