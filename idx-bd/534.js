BD[":F-\x8c"]="For His anger lasts but a moment, / His favor, a lifetime; / Weeping may linger in the evening, / But a ringing shout goes up in the morning."
BD[":E0\x8c"]="The voice of Jehovah shakes the wilderness; / Jehovah shakes the wilderness of Kadesh."
BD["?8*\x8c"]="You shall not take a wife for yourself nor have sons or daughters in this place."
BD[">2E\x8c"]="They go through the pass, saying, / Geba will be our lodging overnight. / Ramah is quaking; / Gibeah of Saul flees away."
BD["?7-\x8c"]="For who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem, / And who will lament for you; / And who will turn aside to ask / After your welfare?"
BD[":C6\x8c"]="Wait for Jehovah; / Be strong, and let your heart be encouraged. / Yes, wait for Jehovah."
BD["?60\x8c"]="O Hope of Israel, / Its Savior in a time of distress, / Why should You be like a sojourner in the land, / Like a traveler who turns aside to lodge for the night?"
BD["D)*\x8c"]="Hear this, you elders, / And give heed, all you inhabitants of the land. / Has this ever happened in your days, / Or even in the days of your fathers?"
BD["?53\x8c"]="For as this girdle clings to the loins of a man, so I have caused all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah to cling to Me, declares Jehovah, that they might be to Me a people and a name and a praise and a glory; but they would not listen."
BD[":A<\x8c"]="Keep my soul, and deliver me; / Do not let me be put to shame, / For I take refuge in You."
BD["?46\x8c"]="Thus says Jehovah concerning all My evil neighbors, who have touched the inheritance which I caused My people Israel to inherit, I am about to pluck them up out of their land, and I will pluck up the house of Judah out from their midst."
BD["?39\x8c"]="And Jehovah of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done for themselves, to provoke Me to anger by burning incense to Baal."
BD["?2<\x8c"]="My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken; / My children have gone from me and they are not; / There is no one who will spread out my tent again / And set up my curtains."
BD[";D*\x8c"]="When a land revolts, it has many rulers; / But by him who has understanding and knowledge it endures."
BD[":>E\x8c"]="All the flourishing of the earth / Will eat and worship. / All who go down into the dust will bow down before Him, / Even he who does not keep his soul alive."
BD["?1?\x8c"]="Thus says Jehovah, / Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, / And let not the mighty man glory in his might; / Let not the rich man glory in his riches."
BD[";C-\x8c"]="Open rebuke is better / Than love that is hidden."
BD[";B0\x8c"]="Like one who binds a stone in a sling, / So is he who gives honor to a fool."
BD["?/E\x8c"]="Cut off your hair and throw it away, / And take up a lamentation on the bare heights; / For Jehovah has rejected and forsaken / The generation of His overflowing wrath."
BD[";A3\x8c"]="A word fitly spoken / Is like apples of gold in settings of silver."
BD[";\@6\x8c"]="Know that wisdom is such for your soul; / If you find it, then there will be a latter end, / And your hope will not be cut off."
BD["::Q\x8c"]="They cried out, but there was no one to save them; / They cried out to Jehovah, but He did not answer them."
BD[";?9\x8c"]="Do not let your heart envy sinners, / But live in the fear of Jehovah all day long;"

Hence, apart from the New Testament believers, the Old Testament believers cannot obtain what God promised. To obtain and enjoy the good things of God&rsquo;s promise, they need the New Testament believers to perfect them. Now they are waiting for us to go on that they may be made perfect."

BD["A2*\x8c"]="And He spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, Go in between the whirling wheels, under the cherub, and fill the hollow of your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in, in my sight."
BD["\@+H\x8c"]="But even if He causes grief, He will have compassion / According to the multitude of His lovingkindness;"
BD["A1-\x8c"]="And to the others He said in my hearing, Pass through the city behind him and strike; do not let your eye pity, and do not spare."
BD["A00\x8c"]="And He said to me, Son of man, dig now through the wall. So I dug through the wall, and there was now an entrance."
BD["A/3\x8c"]="Violence has risen up as a rod of wickedness. Nothing of them remains: nothing of their multitude, nothing of their wealth, and no eminence among them."
BD["A.6\x8c"]="So I will stretch out My hand against them and will make the land desolate, indeed, more desolate than the wilderness of Diblath, in all the places that they dwell; and they will know that I am Jehovah."
BD["A-9\x8c"]="Thus I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they will make you childless; and pestilence and blood will pass through you, and I will bring a sword upon you. I, Jehovah, have spoken."
BD["A+?\x8c"]="So I arose and went forth to the plain. And the glory of Jehovah stood there, like the glory that I had seen by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face."
BD["B/*\x8c"]="Daniel responded and said, I was watching in my vision by night, and there were the four winds of heaven, stirring up the Great Sea."

BD["B*9\x8c"]="Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,"
BD["9I-\x8c"]="If you can, respond to me; / Arrange your words before me; take your stand."
BD["B)<\x8c"]="And in every matter of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and conjurers who were in all his realm."
