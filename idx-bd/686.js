BD["]+*\x97"]="<b>overseer</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word is composed of over and seer; hence, overseer. An overseer in a local church is an elder (<a href=Act.htm#v20_17>Acts 20:17</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v20_28>28</a>). The two titles refer to the same person, elder denoting a person of maturity, and overseer denoting the function of an elder. It was Ignatius in the second century who taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder. From this erroneous teaching came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope. Also, this teaching was the source of the episcopal system of ecclesiastical government. Both the hierarchy and the system are abominable in the eyes of God."

The mentioning here of the rapture of the believers at the Lord&rsquo;s coming is in a general way, as a word of comfort. Details concerning this matter are revealed in other books of the New Testament, such as Matthew and Revelation."
BD["Q\@W\x97"]="<b>forgiveness</b><br> &emsp; Forgiveness of sins could be proclaimed only after the Man-Savior&rsquo;s vicarious death for the sinners&rsquo; sins had been accomplished and had been verified by His resurrection (<a href=Luk.htm#v24_46>v. 46</a>; cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v4_25>Rom. 4:25</a>). The Gospel of John, as the Gospel of the God-Savior, emphasizes life for fruit-bearing (<a href=Joh.htm#v15_5>John 15:5</a>). The Gospel of Luke, as the Gospel of the Man-Savior, stresses forgiveness of sins for proclaiming. To bear fruit in life requires the Spirit of life essentially, received through the breathing of the Spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_22>John 20:22</a>). To proclaim forgiveness of sins requires the Spirit of power economically, received through the baptism in the Spirit (<a href=Act.htm#v1_5>Acts 1:5</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v1_8>8</a>). To bear fruit is a matter of life; to proclaim forgiveness of sins is a matter of power."
