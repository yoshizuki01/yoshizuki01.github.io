After God created man, Satan seduced man to follow him and rebel against God. Then God sent His Son to destroy Satan and rescue man out of his authority back to God&rsquo;s kingdom (<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_8>1&nbsp;John 3:8</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v2_14>Heb. 2:14</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v1_13>Col. 1:13</a>). Now, when the believers worship God in praying to Him or in speaking for Him, they should bear some signs that they are under God&rsquo;s headship, the divine authority, showing the observing angels (cf. <a href=1Co.htm#v4_9>4:9</a>), who are concerned with this matter, that they (the believers) are keeping God&rsquo;s ordained order in His administration. For this, the sisters should have a sign, a covering, on their head."

This building, a mingling of God&rsquo;s divinity with our redeemed, resurrected, and uplifted humanity, becomes God&rsquo;s habitation and our habitation&mdash;a mutual abode (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_23>John 14:23</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v15_4>15:4</a>).

Underneath each pair of branches there was a calyx, which held two branches at the stalk. On each branch there were three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each cup being composed of a calyx (the leafy green bottom of the blossom) and a blossoming bud. The whole flower, including the calyx and the blossom, was a cup shaped like an almond blossom. On the lampstand there were twenty-five calyxes&mdash;one at the base of each pair of branches, three on each of the six branches, and four on the shaft&mdash;and twenty-two blossoms (the three calyxes at the base of each pair of branches did not have blossoms). The divine thought here is that the lampstand is actually a living and growing tree with calyxes and blossoms.<br> &emsp; The lampstand signifies the Triune God embodied and expressed. Pure gold as the substance of the lampstand (<a href=Exo.htm#v25_31>v. 31</a>) signifies God the Father in His divine nature; the form of the lampstand signifies God the Son as the embodiment of God the Father (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_9>John 14:9</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v14_11>11a</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v4_4>2&nbsp;Cor. 4:4b</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v1_15>Col. 1:15</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v2_9>2:9</a>); and the seven lamps (<a href=Exo.htm#v25_37>v. 37</a>) signify God the Spirit being the seven Spirits of God for the sevenfold intensified expression of the Father in the Son (<a href=Rev.htm#v4_5>Rev. 4:5</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v5_6>5:6</a>). The lampstand in this chapter signifies Christ as the embodiment and expression of the Triune God shining with the seven lamps, the seven Spirits of God (<a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v4_16>Matt. 4:16</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_4>John 1:4</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_9>9</a>); the lampstand in <a href=1Ki.htm#v7_49>1&nbsp;Kings 7:49</a> signifies the enlarged Christ; the lampstand in <a href=Zec.htm#v4>Zech. 4</a> signifies the nation of Israel as God&rsquo;s shining testimony with the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit as the reality of Christ (<a href=Zec.htm#v4_2>Zech. 4:2</a>, <a href=Zec.htm#v4_6>6</a>, <a href=Zec.htm#v4_10>10</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v5_6>Rev. 5:6</a>); and the lampstands in <a href=Rev.htm#v1>Rev. 1</a> signify the local churches as the reproduction of Christ and the reprint of the Spirit (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_11>Rev. 1:11</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v1_12>12</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v1_20>20</a>). The consummation and aggregate of all the lampstands in the Scriptures is the New Jerusalem, the ultimate, unique, and eternal golden lampstand, with Christ as the lamp and God as the light shining within Him and through the city for the expression of the Triune God in eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_11>Rev. 21:11</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_18>18</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_23>23</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>22:5</a>). See <a href=RevN.htm#n1_12x3>note 12<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v1>Rev. 1</a>.<br> &emsp; That the lampstand is revealed after the table of the bread of the Presence (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v25_23>23</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v25_30>30</a>) indicates that Christ as the supply of life, signified by the table, becomes the light of life to us (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_4>John 1:4</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v8_12>8:12</a>), signified by the lampstand. The placing of the lampstand in the Holy Place opposite the table and near the Ark (<a href=Exo.htm#v26_34>26:34</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v26_35>35</a>) indicates that in the church the light of the truth (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_5>1&nbsp;John 1:5</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_6>6</a>) and the supply of life must match and balance each other for the carrying on of Christ as God&rsquo;s testimony. In the making and displaying of the furniture of the tabernacle, the lampstand was followed by the incense altar (<a href=Exo.htm#v37_23>37:23</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v37_25>25</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v40_24>40:24</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v40_27>27</a>), indicating that the shining of Christ in resurrection as the divine light leads us to enjoy Christ as the fragrant incense of resurrection in the prayer of fellowship with God. The light from the lampstand directs us to enjoy Christ as our life supply and also guides us into the Holy of Holies to enjoy Christ in the deepest way as the testimony of God with the throne of grace (see notes <a href=ExoN.htm#n25_10x1>10<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=ExoN.htm#n25_17x1>17<sup>1</sup></a>)."

BD["R9?\x8c"]="I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me."

BD["+<D\x97"]="<b>died</b><br> &emsp; On their journey the children of Israel had a number of failures. The book of Numbers shows us that the result of those failures was death, not only of the common Israelites (<a href=Num.htm#v11_1>11:1</a>, <a href=Num.htm#v11_33>33</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v11_34>34</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v14_36>14:36</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v14_37>37</a>, <a href=Num.htm#v14_45>45</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v16_32>16:32</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v16_33>33</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v25_3>25:3</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v25_9>9</a>) but also of Miriam (<a href=Num.htm#v20_1>20:1</a>), Aaron (<a href=Num.htm#v20_23>20:23</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v20_29>29</a>), and Moses (<a href=Num.htm#v27_12>27:12</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v27_14>14</a>). This should be a warning to us to be careful concerning failures because failures result in death, and some even in physical death (cf. <a href=Act.htm#v5_1>Acts 5:1</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v5_11>11</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v11_27>1&nbsp;Cor. 11:27</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v11_30>30</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_16>1&nbsp;John 5:16</a>)."

BD["X+/\x98"]="<b>gift</b><br> &emsp; The grace of God is God Himself, especially as life, partaken of and enjoyed by us; the gift of grace is the ability and function produced out of the enjoyment of the grace of God. Grace implies life, and the gift is the ability that comes out of life."

It was at Bethel that Jacob was actually renewed and became a new person, a transformed person (cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v12_2>Rom. 12:2</a>). This kind of change can be experienced only at Bethel, i.e., in the proper church life. The church is altogether a new man (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_15>Eph. 2:15</a>), and the church life is the new life of the transformed Israel (<a href=Gal.htm#v6_16>Gal. 6:16</a>), which life is God in Christ."
BD["->,\x97"]="<b>turn</b><br> &emsp; After Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had fought along with their brothers, they were qualified to return to their land to enjoy their inheritance.

As God, Christ in His incarnation put on man&rsquo;s flesh (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v2_14>Heb. 2:14</a>). Having become a man in the flesh, i.e., a man in the old creation, He needed to be transformed in His human part. Such a transformed Christ is now the foundation stone, the cornerstone, the living stone, the precious stone, and the topstone in God&rsquo;s divine building (<a href=Isa.htm#v28_16>Isa. 28:16</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v3_11>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:11</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_20>Eph. 2:20</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_4>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:4</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v4_3>Rev. 4:3</a>; <a href=Zec.htm#v4_7>Zech. 4:7</a>).
