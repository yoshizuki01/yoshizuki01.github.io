BD[")<4\x97"]="<b>Jehovah</b><br> &emsp; The title Jehovah your God in this verse indicates that the fifth commandment, related to the honoring of parents, is ranked with the first four commandments, related to God. The reason is that by honoring our parents we honor our source, which ultimately is God Himself (<a href=Luk.htm#v3_23>Luke 3:23</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v3_38>38</a>)."

The apostle was inwardly in fear of missing Christ in his ministry to the wisdom-seeking Greeks, and outwardly in trembling lest he be influenced by their prevailing aspiration for wisdom. By such fear and trembling he stood faithfully and steadfastly in his God-appointed ministry, according to the heavenly vision, avoiding any deviation. The religious Jews were proud of their traditional religion, and the philosophical Greeks were haughty in their worldly wisdom. In ministering Christ to both, the apostle was in fear and in much trembling. What a contrast between him and them!"
BD["O1L\x98"]="<b>sheep</b><br> &emsp; This indicates that the heavenly King considered the Israelites sheep and Himself their Shepherd. When Christ came to the Jews the first time, they were like lepers, paralytics, the demon-possessed, and all manner of pitiful persons because they had no shepherd to care for them. Now in His kingly ministry for the establishing of His heavenly kingdom, He ministered to them not only as a Physician but also as a Shepherd, as prophesied in <a href=Isa.htm#v53_6>Isa. 53:6</a> and <a href=Isa.htm#v40_11>40:11</a>."

In the morning of the same day, He was delivered to Pilate to be judged by him and was sentenced to death (<a href=Mrk.htm#v15_1>15:1</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v15_15>15</a>). Then He was brought to Golgotha and was crucified there at 9:00 a.m., remaining on the cross until 3:00 p.m. (<a href=Mrk.htm#v15_16>15:16</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v15_41>41</a>), for the fulfillment of the type of the Passover (<a href=Exo.htm#v12_6>Exo. 12:6</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v12_11>11</a>; see <a href=MrkN.htm#n12_37x1>note 37<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mrk.htm#v12>Mark 12</a>)."

BD[")6F\x97"]="<b>saved</b><br> &emsp; Like the passing of Noah&rsquo;s ark through the waters of the flood, the crossing of the Red Sea was a type of baptism (<a href=1Co.htm#v10_1>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:1</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v10_2>2</a> and notes <a href=1CoN.htm#n10_1x4>1<sup>4</sup></a> through <a href=1CoN.htm#n10_2x3>2<sup>3</sup></a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v7_17>Gen. 7:17</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v7_23>23</a> and <a href=GenN.htm#n7_17x1>note 17<sup>1</sup></a>). The waters of the Red Sea were used by God to save His people and separate them from Pharaoh and Egypt. The children of Israel were saved through the Red Sea into the wilderness, a realm of resurrection and separation (<a href=Exo.htm#v15_22>15:22</a> and <a href=ExoN.htm#n15_22x1>note 1</a>), where they were free from all bondage and slavery to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose by building the tabernacle as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. Likewise, through baptism the New Testament believers are saved from Satan and the world into a realm of resurrection (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_3>Rom. 6:3</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v6_5>5</a>) and separation (<a href=Act.htm#v2_40>Acts 2:40</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v2_41>41</a>), in which they are free to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose by building up the church as the dwelling place of God.<br> &emsp; This marked the completion of the first stage of God&rsquo;s complete salvation of His chosen people, a stage that included the passover, the exodus from Egypt, and the crossing of the Red Sea. The passover, typifying Christ with His redemption, was sufficient to save God&rsquo;s people from God&rsquo;s righteous judgment (<a href=Exo.htm#v12_12>12:12</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v12_13>13</a>). However, in order to be saved absolutely from the tyranny of Pharaoh and the enslavement in Egypt, the children of Israel needed the exodus and the crossing of the Red Sea. Likewise, after enjoying Christ&rsquo;s redemption to be saved from God&rsquo;s judgment, the New Testament believers need to leave the world and be baptized (cf. <a href=Mrk.htm#v16_16>Mark 16:16a</a> and <a href=MrkN.htm#n16_16x1>note 1</a>)."

Stale fellowship with one another and with God is not acceptable but is abhorrent to God (<a href=Lev.htm#v19_7>v. 7</a>). The one who participates in stale fellowship is guilty of having despised the holy things of God and will lose the fellowship among God&rsquo;s people (<a href=Lev.htm#v19_8>v. 8</a>)."

The silver, gold, and clothing (<a href=Exo.htm#v12_35>v. 35</a>) given to the children of Israel by the Egyptians were used not for the enrichment of God&rsquo;s people but for the building of the tabernacle (<a href=Exo.htm#v25_2>25:2</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v25_8>8</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v35_4>35:4</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v35_9>9</a>).

He had been seeking fruit for three years (<a href=Luk.htm#v13_7>v. 7</a>) but had not found any. He wanted to cut the Jews down, but God the Son as the vinedresser prayed for them, asking God the Father to tolerate them until the Son died for them (dug the ground around the fig tree) and gave them fertilizer (threw on manure), at which point, He hoped, they would repent and produce fruit. Otherwise, they would be cut down. Verses <a href=Luk.htm#v11_29>29</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v11_32>32</a> and <a href=Luk.htm#v11_42>42</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v11_52>52</a> in <a href=Luk.htm#v11>ch. 11</a>, two sections that unveil the Jewish people as an evil generation, confirm this interpretation."
