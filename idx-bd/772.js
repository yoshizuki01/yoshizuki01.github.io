BD["AP9\x97"]="<b>chambers</b><br> &emsp; There were six different sections, or areas, of pavement around the inside of the wall on the east, the south, and the north sides of the outer court, and on each section there were five chambers, giving a total of thirty chambers. In addition to the thirty chambers on the pavement, there were four small courts, one at each corner of the outer court (<a href=Ezk.htm#v46_21>46:21</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v46_24>24</a> and <a href=EzkN.htm#n46_21x1>note 21<sup>1</sup></a>). These were places for the people to boil the sacrifices. The pavement, probably made of stone, signifies the standing of regeneration, which makes us stones (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_42>John 1:42</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>), as a separation from the dirt of the world (cf. <a href=LukN.htm#n15_22x7>note 22<sup>7</sup></a> in <a href=Luk.htm#v15>Luke 15</a>). The chambers were dining places where the people ate the sacrifices, indicating that they were places for people to enjoy Christ as the sacrifices and offerings. (Whereas the priests ate in the inner court [<a href=Ezk.htm#v42_1>42:1</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v42_14>14</a>], the people ate in the outer court.) After passing through the gate of God&rsquo;s dwelling place, we come to the outer court and enter into the chambers, where, standing on the &ldquo;stones&rdquo; of our regeneration, we eat and enjoy Christ, who is the reality of all the offerings (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_5>Heb. 10:5</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_10>10</a>)."

Three generations&mdash;Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah&mdash;were omitted. This must have been because of the evil marriage of Joram and the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, which corrupted Joram&rsquo;s descendants (<a href=2Ch.htm#v21_5>2&nbsp;Chron. 21:5</a>-<a href=2Ch.htm#v21_6>6</a>; <a href=2Ch.htm#v22_1>22:1</a>-<a href=2Ch.htm#v22_4>4</a>).

Christ is both the complete God and the perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctly, without a third nature being produced. Through the divine mingling Christ&rsquo;s humanity has been uplifted to the highest standard. In His divinity Christ has the divine attributes, and these divine attributes are expressed through, with, and in His human virtues. This is the excellence of Jesus Christ.<br> &emsp; In the meal offering the oil and the fine flour are mingled and cannot be separated. Hence, to eat the fine flour is to eat the oil. The picture in <a href=Lev.htm#v2>Lev. 2</a> indicates strongly that the way for us to be nourished with Christ&rsquo;s humanity, and thus to experience His human living, is by the Spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_51>John 6:51</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v6_57>57</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v6_63>63</a>)."

BD["M.3\x97"]="<b>splendid</b><br> &emsp; The previous eight visions of comfort, consolation, and encouragement are confirmed by the crowning of Joshua the high priest&mdash;typifying Christ in His priesthood&mdash;linked with Zerubbabel the governor of Judah (vv. <a href=Zec.htm#v6_12>12</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v6_13>13</a>), typifying Christ as the Shoot of David in His kingship (see notes <a href=ZecN.htm#n3_1x1>1<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=ZecN.htm#n3_8x1>8<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Zec.htm#v3>ch. 3</a>). Christ, typified in vv. <a href=Zec.htm#v6_11>11</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v6_13>13</a> by two persons, Joshua and Zerubbabel, is the unique One to hold the two offices of the priesthood and the kingship. In all history He is the only person qualified to bear the responsibilities of these two offices in God&rsquo;s administration. Thus, in <a href=Heb.htm#v7>Hebrews 7</a> Christ is both the High Priest and the King, as typified by Melchizedek (cf. <a href=Gen.htm#v14_18>Gen. 14:18</a>). Because Melchizedek bore the two offices of the priesthood and the kingship, he was a type of Christ as the One who would bear both the priesthood and the kingship in God&rsquo;s administration."
