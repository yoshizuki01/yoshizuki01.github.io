BD[":R)\x99"]="<b>God</b><br> &emsp; <a href=Psa.htm#v1>Psalm 1</a>, the opening word of Book One, begins with the law, but Book Two begins with God. Surely there is no comparison between God and the law. This shows us that Book Two of the Psalms is higher than Book One. Among the five books of the Psalms, the revelation is progressive. The Psalms are like a stairway of five steps that takes us higher in its revelation in a progressive way.<br> &emsp; In Book One the psalmists were turned from the law to Christ, and Christ brought them to the enjoyment of God in His house and in His city. Book Two begins with the direct enjoyment of God and unveils the psalmists&rsquo; intensified enjoyment of God in His house, and even more in His city, through the suffering, exalted, and reigning Christ. Such a Christ is the way for sinners to enter into God (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_6>John 14:6</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v14_20>20</a>). God&rsquo;s house is both Christ as God&rsquo;s tabernacle and God&rsquo;s temple (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v2_19>2:19</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v2_21>21</a>) and the church as the enlargement of Christ, the enlarged temple (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_16>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:16</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_21>Eph. 2:21</a>). Jerusalem, the city of God that surrounded the temple, signifies God&rsquo;s kingdom. Both Christ and the church are the temple of God and the kingdom of God (<a href=Luk.htm#v17_21>Luke 17:21</a> and <a href=LukN.htm#n17_21x1>note 1</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_19>19</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n16_19x2>note 19<sup>2</sup></a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v14_17>Rom. 14:17</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n14_17x1>note 1</a>). The New Jerusalem will be the consummation of God&rsquo;s temple and God&rsquo;s kingdom (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_22>Rev. 21:22</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n21_22x1>note 1</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>22:1</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_3>3</a>)."
