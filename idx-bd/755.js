BD["i),\x98"]="<b>Asia</b><br> &emsp; Asia was a province of the ancient Roman Empire, and in that province were the seven cities mentioned in <a href=Rev.htm#v1_11>v. 11</a>. The seven churches were in those seven cities, respectively; they were not all in one city. This book does not deal with the one universal church but with the local churches in many cities. First, in <a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a> the church is revealed as universal, and then in <a href=Mat.htm#v18_17>Matt. 18:17</a> it is revealed as local. In Acts the church was practiced in the way of local churches, such as the church in Jerusalem (<a href=Act.htm#v8_1>Acts 8:1</a>), the church in Antioch (<a href=Act.htm#v13_1>Acts 13:1</a>), the church in Ephesus (<a href=Act.htm#v20_17>Acts 20:17</a>), and the churches in the provinces of Syria and Cilicia (<a href=Act.htm#v15_41>Acts 15:41</a>). The Epistles were written to the local churches, except for a few written to individuals. Not one was written to the universal church. Without the local churches, the universal church has no practicality or actuality. The universal church is realized in the local churches. Knowing the church in its universal aspect must be consummated in knowing the church in its local aspect. It is a great advance for us to know and practice the local churches. Concerning the church, the book of Revelation is in the advanced stage. To know this book, we must advance from the understanding of the universal church to the realization and practice of the local churches, because this book is written to the local churches. Only those who are in the local churches are positioned rightly, with the right angle and the proper perspective, to see the visions in this book.<br> &emsp; The Triune God is expressed in Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>John 1:1</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>14</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v3_16>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:16</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>); Christ is realized and experienced as the Spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_16>John 14:16</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v14_18>18</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:17</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_9>Rom. 8:9</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v1_19>Phil. 1:19</a>) and is expressed in His Body, the universal church (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_22>Eph. 1:22</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>23</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v12_12>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:12</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v4_4>Eph. 4:4</a>); and the universal church is expressed in the local churches. Therefore, to know and experience God, we need to know and experience Christ; to know and experience Christ, we need to participate in the universal church through the Spirit; and to participate in the universal church, we need to participate in the local churches."

BD["9H2\x97"]="<b>know</b><br> &emsp; Elihu&rsquo;s speaking indicates that he was quite proud. Although he was full of assurance that he could answer Job adequately concerning God&rsquo;s purpose in dealing with Job, in all his speaking Elihu did not answer Job with a clear view like the apostle Paul&rsquo;s clear vision in the New Testament concerning the goal of gaining Christ in his suffering the loss of all things (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_8>Phil. 3:8</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_14>14</a>) and concerning the believers&rsquo; affliction working out for them an eternal weight of glory (<a href=2Co.htm#v4_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 4:17</a>). Elihu&rsquo;s word had nothing of the divine wisdom. With Paul, however, there was a clear word of revelation. Hence, Paul&rsquo;s word was truly the word of wisdom (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_8>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:8</a>).<br> &emsp; Furthermore, the speaking of Job, of his three friends, and of Elihu was altogether lacking in the exercise of the spirit to contact God. They spoke concerning God, and they also referred to their spirit, but in all their debates there is no hint that they were exercising their spirit. Rather, they exercised their mind to make a display of their knowledge. In this matter Elihu followed the example of the older ones and spoke in the same way. Elihu was a person who was full of the knowledge of good and evil. He was not a person in the spirit (cf. <a href=Rev.htm#v1_10>Rev. 1:10</a>)."

BD["D),\x97"]="<b>cutting</b><br> &emsp; Four words for locust are used in this verse, probably referring to one kind of locust in various stages of growth. The four stages of this one kind of locust refer to the nations that devastated Israel in four consecutive empires: Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, including Antichrist, who will be the last Caesar of the Roman Empire (<a href=Rev.htm#v17_8>Rev. 17:8</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v17_11>11</a>). The armies of these empires were like locusts (<a href=Joe.htm#v2_25>2:25</a>) coming to devastate and consume Israel totally, devouring her people, land, fields, produce, food, and drink and cutting off her offerings. These empires correspond to the four sections of the great human image in <a href=Dan.htm#v2>Dan. 2</a>, to the four beasts in <a href=Dan.htm#v7>Dan. 7</a>, and to the four horns in <a href=Zec.htm#v1>Zech. 1</a>. They will be overcome and terminated by Christ, who will set up the kingdom and reign among the saved Israel in the age of restoration (<a href=Joe.htm#v3>ch. 3</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v2_34>Dan. 2:34</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v2_35>35</a> and <a href=DanN.htm#n2_34x1>notes</a>).<br> &emsp; Beginning approximately two hundred years before the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, God sent the prophets to warn Israel, to advise them, and to call them to return to God. However, Israel did not listen to the prophets. This forced God to send the four kinds of locusts to chastise His people. Israel has been suffering the cutting, swarming, licking, and consuming of the locusts for twenty-seven centuries. God&rsquo;s purpose in allowing Israel to suffer under the locusts was to bring forth a couple, Joseph and Mary, so that God could be born in man, of man, and out of man to become no longer only God but a God-man (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v1>Matt. 1</a>). Hence, God used the suffering of the Jews to bring in the incarnation, an unprecedented event that brought God into man and mingled God and man as one. Furthermore, God has used the locusts to afford all the necessary facilities in the environment for the carrying out of His purpose. The Roman Empire, the aggregate of the four empires, afforded everything necessary for the incarnated God to live and move and work on earth. It also provided the means for Christ to be crucified for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s redemption (<a href=Joh.htm#v18_31>John 18:31</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v18_32>32</a>), the occasion for the pouring out of the Spirit as the processed and consummated Triune God upon all flesh to produce the church as the organic Body of Christ (<a href=Act.htm#v2>Acts 2</a>), and the facilities for the spreading of the gospel to the entire inhabited earth (<a href=Mat.htm#v28_19>Matt. 28:19</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v1_8>Acts 1:8</a>).<br> &emsp; The Bible is a record of two histories: the history of man, the human history, and the history of God, the divine history. The former is like an outward shell, and the latter, like the kernel within the shell. In the Minor Prophets the human history is clearly defined and is signified by the four kinds of locusts mentioned in this verse. The divine history within the human history is also revealed in considerable detail. The divine history, as the divine mystery of the Triune God in humanity, began in eternity past with the eternal God and His eternal economy (<a href=Mic.htm#v5_2>Micah 5:2c</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v1_4>1&nbsp;Tim. 1:4</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v1_4>Eph. 1:4</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_5>5</a>, <a href=Eph.htm#v1_9>9</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_11>11</a>). It continues with Christ&rsquo;s incarnation (<a href=Mic.htm#v5_2>Micah 5:2a</a>); His death, burial, and resurrection for the spreading of God&rsquo;s redemption and salvation to all the nations on earth (<a href=Jon.htm#v1_17>Jonah 1:17</a>; <a href=Jon.htm#v2_10>2:10</a>); His pouring out of the consummated Spirit to produce the church as the corporate expression of the Triune God (<a href=Joe.htm#v2_28>2:28</a>-<a href=Joe.htm#v2_32>32</a>); His second coming as the Desire of nations (<a href=Hag.htm#v2_7>Hag. 2:7a</a>) and as the Sun of righteousness (<a href=Mal.htm#v4_2>Mal. 4:2a</a>); His coming with His overcomers as His army to defeat Antichrist and his army (<a href=Joe.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>-<a href=Joe.htm#v3_15>15</a>); and His reigning in Zion in the thousand-year kingdom (<a href=Joe.htm#v3_16>3:16</a>-<a href=Joe.htm#v3_21>21</a>; <a href=Mic.htm#v4_7>Micah 4:7</a>). Eventually, the kingdom will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth for eternity. The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate, the consummate, step of God&rsquo;s history."
