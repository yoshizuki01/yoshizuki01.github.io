It is this law, not God nor the Spirit, that works in us to deliver us from the working of the law of sin in our flesh and to enable us to know God and gain God and thereby live Him out. This law of the Spirit of life is the spontaneous power of the Spirit of life. Such a spontaneous law works automatically under the condition that fulfills its requirements (see <a href=RomN.htm#n8_4x2>note 4<sup>2</sup></a>).<br> &emsp; Both Satan and God, after entering into our being and dwelling in us, work within us not by outward, objective activities but by an inward, subjective law.

Here another opportunity was created for Him to reveal Himself, this time as the children&rsquo;s bread. The Canaanite woman considered Him the Lord&mdash;a divine person&mdash;and the Son of David&mdash;a royal descendant, great and high in His reign. But He unveiled Himself to her as small pieces of bread, good for food. This implies that as the heavenly King, He rules over His people by feeding them with Himself as bread.

BD["O5H\x97"]="<b>tree</b><br> &emsp; The church, which is the embodiment of the kingdom, should be like an herb that produces food.

This change happened in the first part of the fourth century, when Constantine the Great mixed the church with the world. He brought thousands of false believers into Christianity, making it Christendom, no longer the church. Hence, this third parable corresponds with the third of the seven churches in <a href=Rev.htm#v2>Rev. 2</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v3>3</a>, the church in Pergamos (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_12>Rev. 2:12</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v2_17>17</a>&mdash;see <a href=RevN.htm#n2_12x1>note 12<sup>1</sup></a> there). The mustard is an annual herb, whereas the tree is a perennial plant. The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard, sojourning on the earth. But with its nature changed, the church became deeply rooted and settled as a tree in the earth, flourishing with its enterprises as the branches in which many evil persons and things are lodged. This resulted in the formation of the outward organization of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens."
