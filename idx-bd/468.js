BD["c-5\x98"]="<b>Babylon</b><br> &emsp; Through the centuries the great teachers have held two different interpretations of this name: that it is figurative, referring to Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire, or that it is literal, referring to Babylon, a large city on the Euphrates (Perath). The reasons for the latter interpretation are more logical than those for the former. First, it seems that Peter had no reason to use a figurative name to hide the name of the city he was in at the time. Second, all the names he used for the places in the address of his Epistle (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_1>1:1</a>) were literal. Third, in the New Testament the name Rome is always clearly mentioned (<a href=Act.htm#v19_21>Acts 19:21</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v28_14>28:14</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v28_16>16</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v1_7>Rom. 1:7</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v1_15>15</a>), even up to the time of the writing of Paul&rsquo;s last Epistle, 2&nbsp;Timothy (<a href=2Ti.htm#v1_17>2&nbsp;Tim. 1:17</a>), which was written probably after 1&nbsp;Peter. It was when John&rsquo;s Revelation, a book of figures, was written, about A.D. 90, that the figurative name Babylon the Great was used for the city of Rome (<a href=Rev.htm#v17_5>Rev. 17:5</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v18_2>18:2</a>)."

BD["?*5\x97"]="<b>fountain</b><br> &emsp; Jeremiah, a book full of speaking concerning Israel&rsquo;s sin and God&rsquo;s wrath, chastisement, and punishment, reveals that God&rsquo;s intention in His economy is to be the fountain, the source, of living waters to dispense Himself into His chosen people for their satisfaction and enjoyment. The goal of this enjoyment is to produce the church, God&rsquo;s counterpart, as God&rsquo;s increase, God&rsquo;s enlargement, to be God&rsquo;s fullness for His expression (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_29>John 3:29</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_30>30</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v3_16>Eph. 3:16</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v3_19>19</a>, <a href=Eph.htm#v3_21>21</a>). This is the heart&rsquo;s desire, the good pleasure, of God in His economy (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_5>Eph. 1:5</a>, <a href=Eph.htm#v1_9>9</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v3_9>3:9</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v3_11>11</a>). The full development of this thought, sown as a seed in this verse, is in the New Testament (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_10>John 4:10</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v4_14>14</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v7_37>7:37</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v7_39>39</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v10_4>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:4</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v12_13>12:13</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>Rev. 22:1</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_17>17</a>).<br> &emsp; Israel should have drunk of God as the fountain of living waters that they might become His increase as His expression, but instead they committed two evils: they forsook God as their fountain, their source, and they turned to a source other than God. These two evils govern the entire book of Jeremiah. The hewing out of cisterns portrays Israel&rsquo;s toil in their human labor to make something (idols) to replace God. That the cisterns were broken and could hold no water indicates that apart from God Himself dispensed into us as living water, nothing can quench our thirst and make us God&rsquo;s increase for His expression (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_13>John 4:13</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v4_14>14</a>)."

He left Chaldea, the idolatrous land of curse, crossed the flood, the river Perath, or Euphrates (<a href=Jos.htm#v24_2>Josh. 24:2</a>-<a href=Jos.htm#v24_3>3</a>), and came to Canaan, the good land of blessing. Yet he did not settle there; rather, he sojourned in the land of promise as a pilgrim, even as an exile, an expatriate, longing after a better country, a heavenly one (<a href=Heb.htm#v11_16>v. 16</a>), seeking a country of his own (<a href=Heb.htm#v11_14>v. 14</a>). This might imply that he was ready to cross another river, from the earthly side to the heavenly side. Isaac and Jacob followed him in the same steps, living on the earth as strangers and sojourners and waiting for the God-built city that has the foundations (<a href=Heb.htm#v11_10>v. 10</a>). The word in vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v11_9>9</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v11_16>16</a> may imply that the writer of this book intended to impress on the memory of the believing Hebrews the fact that they, as the real Hebrews, should follow their forefathers, considering themselves strangers and sojourners on the earth and looking forward to the heavenly country, which is better than the earthly one."
