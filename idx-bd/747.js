BD["O3+\x97"]="<b>Are</b><br> &emsp; John the Baptist&rsquo;s word here does not mean that he was in doubt concerning Christ. He questioned Christ in this way in order to provoke Him to deliver him. He knew that Christ was the Coming One, and he had strongly recommended Him to the people (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_26>John 1:26</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_36>36</a>). After that, John was put into prison (<a href=Mat.htm#v4_12>4:12</a>), where he waited, expecting that Christ would do something to deliver him. However, Christ did nothing for him, although He did much to help others. When John heard of this, it might have been that he was about to be stumbled (<a href=Mat.htm#v11_6>v. 6</a>). Hence, he sent his disciples with such a question to provoke Christ."

The Lord&rsquo;s word in <a href=Joh.htm#v12_31>John 12:31</a> confirms this. After he rebelled against God and became God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, he was judged by God (<a href=Isa.htm#v14_12>Isa. 14:12</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v14_15>15</a>), but the full execution of God&rsquo;s judgment upon him will not be completed until the end of the millennium (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_7>Rev. 20:7</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_10>10</a>). Hence, until that time he has authority over the kingdoms of the earth. He tempted the Lord Jesus by offering this authority and its glory to Him. His evil offer was rejected by God&rsquo;s Christ, but it will be accepted by the Antichrist, the man of lawlessness (<a href=2Th.htm#v2_3>2&nbsp;Thes. 2:3</a>-<a href=2Th.htm#v2_4>4</a>), at the end of this age (<a href=Rev.htm#v13_4>Rev. 13:4</a>) for the executing of Satan&rsquo;s evil strategy against God.
