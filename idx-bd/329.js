BD["AI)\x97"]="<b>Then</b><br> &emsp; God always executes His judgment with a purpose. The purpose of God&rsquo;s judgment is to bring in recovery. Through His judgment, which is based on His righteousness, holiness, and glory, God desires to recover His people according to His righteousness, holiness, and glory. Whereas God&rsquo;s judgment is by various means (<a href=Ezk.htm#v5_4>5:4</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v14_21>14:21</a>), God&rsquo;s recovery is by life.<br> &emsp; The visions regarding the Lord&rsquo;s recovery by life in chs. <a href=Ezk.htm#v33>33</a>&mdash;<a href=Ezk.htm#v39>39</a>, with the issue of God&rsquo;s holy building in chs. <a href=Ezk.htm#v40>40</a>&mdash;<a href=Ezk.htm#v48>48</a>, should be applied to Israel in the restoration, the millennium, beginning with the Lord&rsquo;s second coming (<a href=Act.htm#v3_20>Acts 3:20</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v3_21>21</a>). These visions should also be applied to the believers in Christ in their experience of the divine life in the New Testament age (cf. <a href=JerN.htm#n31_31x1>note 31<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Jer.htm#v31>Jer. 31</a>)."
BD[":^)\x97"]="<b>save</b><br> &emsp; In this psalm, instead of asking God to have mercy on his enemies in His faithfulness, David asked God to annihilate his enemies (<a href=Psa.htm#v54_5>v. 5</a>), while he himself was seeking to participate in the enjoyment of God in His help, sustenance, and salvation (vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v54_1>1</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v54_4>4</a>). A spiritual person would not pray in such a way.

This is against the nature of the spiritual life of God&rsquo;s chosen people, and even against God&rsquo;s holy word in the Old Testament in <a href=Prv.htm#v25_21>Prov. 25:21</a>-<a href=Prv.htm#v25_22>22</a>, quoted by the apostle Paul in <a href=Rom.htm#v12_20>Rom. 12:20</a>.
