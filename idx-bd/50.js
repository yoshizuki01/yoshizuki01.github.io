The first Adam (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>v. 45</a>) is the beginning of mankind; the last Adam is the ending. As the first man, Adam is the head of the old creation, representing it in creation. As the second man, Christ is the Head of the new creation, representing it in resurrection. In the entire universe there are only two men: the first man, Adam, including all his descendants, and the second man, Christ, comprising all His believers. We believers were included in the first man by birth and became a part of the second man by regeneration. Our believing has transferred us out of the first man into the second. In regard to our being part of the first man, our origin is the earth and our nature is earthy. In regard to our being part of the second man, our origin is God and our nature is heavenly."

BD["^+*\x98"]="<b>lovers</b><br> &emsp; In 1 and 2&nbsp;Timothy and Titus seven kinds of lovers are mentioned: (1) lovers of self, (2) lovers of money (<a href=2Ti.htm#v3_2>v. 2</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v6_10>1&nbsp;Tim. 6:10</a>), (3) lovers of pleasure, (4) lovers of God (<a href=2Ti.htm#v3_4>v. 4</a>), (5) lovers of good (<a href=Tit.htm#v1_8>Titus 1:8</a>), (6) lovers of husbands, and (7) lovers of children (<a href=Tit.htm#v2_4>Titus 2:4</a>). Also, two kinds of nonlovers are mentioned: (1) nonlovers of good, and (2) nonlovers of God (vv. <a href=2Ti.htm#v3_3>3</a>-<a href=2Ti.htm#v3_4>4</a>). Whatever one loves, his whole heart, even his entire being, is set on and occupied and possessed by. This is crucial! Whether there would be a day of glory in the church&rsquo;s victory or grievous days of the church&rsquo;s decline depends altogether on what kind of lovers we are. History tells us that the root of the church&rsquo;s decline was the loss of her first love toward the Lord (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_4>Rev. 2:4</a>). To maintain the victorious standard of the church, we must be lovers of God and lovers of the good that pertains to God&rsquo;s economy."

Unlike many of the kings of Israel and Judah, he was not selfish, he did not seek his own interests, and he was not indulgent in sexual lust. Therefore, he was qualified to enjoy the top portion, the kingship of the good land promised by God to His elect. Instead of being self-seeking, he lent money and grain without interest (<a href=Neh.htm#v5_10>v. 10</a>), and he fed others for the purpose of building up the wall. As a result, he was used by God and received help from Him to carry out the work of rebuilding the wall of the city of Jerusalem (<a href=Neh.htm#v6_15>6:15</a>&mdash;<a href=Neh.htm#v7_4>7:4</a>). Nehemiah was a pattern of what a leader among God&rsquo;s people should be (cf. <a href=1Ti.htm#v3_2>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:2</a>-<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_7>7</a>)."

After his success in his victory Dan became a serpent, a viper, acting individualistically and independently in his pride to set up an idol and a divisive center of worship and to ordain a hired priest in the city of Dan during the time that the house of God was in Shiloh (<a href=Jdg.htm#v18_30>Judg. 18:30</a>-<a href=Jdg.htm#v18_31>31</a>; cf. <a href=Deu.htm#v12_5>Deut. 12:5</a> and <a href=DeuN.htm#n12_5x1>note</a>). As a serpent Dan bit the horse&rsquo;s heels so that its rider fell backward, signifying that the apostasy brought in by Dan became a great stumbling block to the nation of Israel. Throughout the history of the church many spiritual people have followed Dan&rsquo;s example, thereby frustrating God&rsquo;s people from going on in His ordained way. A further fulfillment of Jacob&rsquo;s prophecy concerning Dan is seen in <a href=1Ki.htm#v12_26>1&nbsp;Kings 12:26</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v12_31>31</a> (see <a href=1KiN.htm#n12_27x1>notes</a> there)."
