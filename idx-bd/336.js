According to the sequence of historical events, Christ&rsquo;s ascension preceded His being preached among the nations. However, it is listed here as the last step in Christ&rsquo;s being the manifestation of God in the flesh. This must indicate that the church too is taken up in glory. Hence, it implies that not only Christ Himself as the Head but also the church as the Body are the manifestation of God in the flesh. When a church is well taken care of according to the instructions given in the first two chapters, with the oversight of the episcopate and the service of the deacons fully established, as revealed in <a href=1Ti.htm#v3>ch. 3</a>, the church will function as the house and household of the living God for His move on the earth, and as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world. Then the church becomes the continuation of Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh. This is the great mystery of godliness&mdash;Christ lived out of the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh!"

Then, as One who is in resurrection, He will come to the earth with the kingdom of God (<a href=Dan.htm#v7_13>Dan. 7:13</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v7_14>14</a>) to exercise God&rsquo;s power and subdue everything on earth. This will continue for a thousand years (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>Rev. 20:4</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>). The last enemy to be abolished is death. The swallowing up of death will result in the ultimate victory of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, that is, in the ultimate and complete victory that He has accomplished in resurrection for us who believe in Him and participate in His resurrection. This is the ultimate issue of His resurrection for His and God&rsquo;s eternal kingdom and for the eternal enjoyment of His resurrection life in eternity by those who believe in Him."
