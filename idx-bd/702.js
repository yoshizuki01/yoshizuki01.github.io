He unveiled the crucial things related to God&rsquo;s economy, concerning which things the prophets prophesied and the apostles preached (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_10>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:10</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_12>12</a>), from four sides:<br> &emsp; (1) From the side of the Triune God:<br> &emsp; God the Father chose a people in eternity according to His foreknowledge (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_1>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:1</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_2>2</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_9>2:9</a>) and called them into His glory (<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_10>1&nbsp;Pet. 5:10</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v1_3>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:3</a>).

Then the new heavens and new earth will come as a new universe, in which God&rsquo;s righteousness will dwell for eternity (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_13>v. 13</a>).<br> &emsp; Paul in his writings also spoke concerning &ldquo;these things&rdquo; (except for the new heavens and new earth). Hence, Peter referred to Paul&rsquo;s writings to strengthen his own writings, especially concerning God&rsquo;s governmental and disciplinary judgment upon the believers. Paul strongly and repeatedly emphasized this matter in his writings (<a href=1Co.htm#v11_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 11:30</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v11_32>32</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v12_5>Heb. 12:5</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v12_11>11</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v2_3>2:3</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v4_1>4:1</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v6_8>6:8</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_27>10:27</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_31>31</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v10_39>39</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v12_29>12:29</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v3_13>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:13</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_15>15</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v4_4>4:4</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v4_5>5</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v5_10>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:10</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v14_10>Rom. 14:10</a>). This must be the reason Peter highly commended Paul&rsquo;s writings.<br> &emsp; What beauty and excellency are in this commendation! Although the Corinthians attempted to divide Peter and Paul according to their divisive preferences (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_11>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:11</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v1_12>12</a>), Peter commended Paul, saying that Paul, like him, taught &ldquo;these things&rdquo; and that Paul&rsquo;s writings should not be twisted but should be regarded like &ldquo;the rest of the Scriptures&rdquo; and should receive the same respect as the Old Testament. For Peter to make such a commendation was not a small thing, for it was he who was rebuked to his face by Paul regarding the New Testament faith (<a href=Gal.htm#v2_11>Gal. 2:11</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v2_21>21</a>). This indicates that Peter was bold in admitting that the early apostles, such as John, Paul, and himself, although their style, terminology, utterance, certain aspects of their views, and the way they presented their teachings differed, participated in the same, unique ministry, the ministry of the New Testament (<a href=2Co.htm#v3_8>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:8</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v3_9>9</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v4_1>4:1</a>). Such a ministry ministers to people, as its focus, the all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, who, after passing through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, dispenses Himself through the redemption of Christ and by the operation of the Holy Spirit into His redeemed people as their unique portion of life and as their life supply and everything, for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the full expression, the fullness, of the Triune God, according to the eternal purpose of the Father."
