BD["b,4\x8c"]="One is Lawgiver and Judge, who is able to save and destroy. But who are you who judge your neighbor?"
BD["b+7\x8c"]="This wisdom is not that which descends from above, but is earthly, soulish, demonic."

BD["b*:\x8c"]="But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works."
BD["b)=\x8c"]="Therefore putting away all filthiness and the abundance of malice, receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls."
BD["b)9\x98"]="<b>Father</b><br> &emsp; Lights here refers to the heavenly luminaries. The Father is the Creator, the source, of these shining bodies. With Him there is no shadow cast by turning (in contrast to the situation with the heavenly orbs, where the moon waxes and wanes by its revolving, and the sun can be eclipsed by the moon), for He is not variable, not changeable. As such, He is incapable of being tempted by evil, nor does He tempt anyone."
BD["c,+\x8c"]="For the time which has passed is sufficient <I>for</I> <I>you</I> to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having gone on in licentiousness, lusts, debaucheries, carousings, drinking bouts, and lawless idolatries."
BD[":\x9fC\x8c"]="Cause me to understand the way of Your precepts, / And I will muse upon Your wondrous deeds."
BD["c+.\x8c"]="As Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose children you have become, if you do good and do not fear any terror."
BD[":7*\x97"]="<b>He</b><br> &emsp; According to vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v15_2>2</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v15_5>5</a>, David&rsquo;s concept was that the man who is perfect according to the law may dwell with God for His heart&rsquo;s desire and good pleasure. Thus, <a href=Psa.htm#v15_5>v. 5</a> says that he who does the good things of the law will not be shaken forever (cf. <a href=Psa.htm#v16_8>16:8</a>). However, <a href=Psa.htm#v16>Psa. 16</a> reveals that only Christ, the God-man, can satisfy God&rsquo;s desire and fulfill His good pleasure (<a href=Mat.htm#v3_17>Matt. 3:17</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v17_5>17:5</a>). Only He&mdash;the very God who became a man, lived a human life full of the divine attributes expressed in human virtues, died, resurrected, and ascended to the right hand of God&mdash;is perfect according to the law and can sojourn in God&rsquo;s tabernacle and dwell with God on His holy mountain. In God&rsquo;s economy only the God-man Christ as the firstborn Son of God with His many brothers as the many sons of God (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>Rom. 8:29</a>) can satisfy God&rsquo;s desire and fulfill His good pleasure."
BD["c*1\x8c"]="But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;"
BD["c+*\x98"]="<b>in</b><br> &emsp; In fear modifies pure manner of life."
BD["c)4\x8c"]="To them it was revealed that not to themselves but to you they ministered these things, which have now been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, which things angels long to look into."
BD["a2+\x8c"]="But in those <I>sacrifices</I> there is a bringing to mind of sins year by year;"

BD["a1.\x8c"]="Now these things having been thus prepared, into the first tabernacle the priests enter continually, accomplishing their worship;"
BD["a01\x8c"]="Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord."
BD["a/4\x8c"]="For since the priesthood is transferred, of necessity there comes into being a transfer of law also."
BD["=.*\x97"]="<b>garden</b><br> &emsp; After seeking help from others, she realizes that her Beloved is within her as His garden and in all the other believers as His beds of spices, feeding in her and other believers as His gardens and gathering the pure and trusting ones (lilies). Christ&rsquo;s garden is in our spirit. If we live in our spirit, our spirit becomes a garden in which we grow all the beautiful, spiritual, divine, and heavenly things, which are sweet to His taste."
BD["a.7\x8c"]="And thus when <I>Abraham</I> had patiently endured, he obtained the promise."

BD["=,0\x97"]="<b>Lebanon</b><br> &emsp; Here Christ asks His lover as His bride to look with Him from His ascension (Lebanon), the highest place of the truth (Amana) and of Christ&rsquo;s victory in His fighting (Senir and Hermon), and from the heavenly places of the enemies (the lions&rsquo; dens and the leopards&rsquo; mountains). Christ calls His lover to live with Him in His ascension, as He had called her to remain in His cross (<a href=SoS.htm#v2_14>2:14</a>). When the lover is living in ascension, she and Christ are living in one condition, the condition of ascension, to be a couple. Christ is divine and human, and His transformed lover is human and divine. They are the same in life and nature, perfectly matching one another."
BD["a-6\x98"]="<b>good</b><br> &emsp; Good and evil here refers to what is superior in contrast to what is inferior, e.g., the superiority of Christ in contrast to the inferiority of the angels, Moses, and Aaron, or the superiority of the new covenant in contrast to the inferiority of the old covenant. According to the context of this verse, the discriminating mentioned here is similar to discriminating between different foods and has nothing to do with the moral nature of things."
BD["=+3\x97"]="<b>look</b><br> &emsp; The Spirit, signified here by a third party speaking, bids the overcoming believers (daughters of Zion&mdash;see <a href=PsaN.htm#n48_2x1>note 2<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Psa.htm#v48>Psa. 48</a>) to look away from themselves unto Christ in His humanity, which is a crown with which His mother (incarnation) crowned Him on the day of the believers&rsquo; betrothal to Him, a day of the gladness of His heart. Here the lover of Christ and Christ are united to be one in the bridal love and marriage life. This portrays the church and Christ being united to be completely and fully one organically in the mingled spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v6_17>1&nbsp;Cor. 6:17</a>)."
BD["=*6\x97"]="<b>My</b><br> &emsp; Here Christ, considering her His simple lover (My dove), wants to see His lover&rsquo;s lovely countenance and hear her sweet voice in her oneness, union, with the cross, signified here by the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice. This is Christ&rsquo;s call for His lover to be in oneness with the cross (cf. <a href=Luk.htm#v9_23>Luke 9:23</a>). Only the cross of Christ can deliver her from the situation caused by introspection.<br> &emsp; Christ wants His seeker to remain in the cross, in a crucified condition, continually (<a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20a</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v15_31>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:31</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v4_10>2&nbsp;Cor. 4:10</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v4_11>11</a>). However, to remain in the cross is a difficult matter, like entering into the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice high in the mountains by a rugged road. In order to empower and encourage His lover to rise up and come away from her low situation in her introspection of the self, Christ empowers her by showing her the power of His resurrection (vv. <a href=SoS.htm#v2_8>8</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v2_9>9a</a>), and He encourages her by the flourishing riches of His resurrection (vv. <a href=SoS.htm#v2_11>11</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v2_13>13</a>). It is by the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, not by our natural life, that we, the lovers of Christ, determine to take the cross by denying our self (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_24>Matt. 16:24</a>). It is also by the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection that we are enabled to be conformed to His death by being one with His cross (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_10>Phil. 3:10</a>). The reality of resurrection is the pneumatic Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v11_25>John 11:25</a>), who as the consummated Spirit indwells and is mingled with our regenerated spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v6_17>1&nbsp;Cor. 6:17</a> and <a href=1CoN.htm#n6_17x1>notes</a>). It is in such a mingled spirit that we participate in and experience the resurrection of Christ, which enables us to be one with the cross to be delivered from the self and to be transformed into a new man in God&rsquo;s new creation for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy in the building up of the organic Body of Christ."
