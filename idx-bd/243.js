It is he who will need to be judged and destroyed. All people in Adam are dead (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_22>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:22</a>); thus, the evil Antichrist, who with his evil armies will war against the Lord at Armageddon (<a href=Rev.htm#v19_17>Rev. 19:17</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v19_21>21</a>), is in the eyes of the Lord a stinking corpse, good for the vultures&rsquo; appetite. Furthermore, in the Scriptures both the Lord and those who trust in Him are likened to an eagle (<a href=Exo.htm#v19_4>Exo. 19:4</a>; <a href=Deu.htm#v32_11>Deut. 32:11</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v40_31>Isa. 40:31</a>), and the swift, destroying armies are likened to flying eagles (<a href=Deu.htm#v28_49>Deut. 28:49</a>; <a href=Hos.htm#v8_1>Hosea 8:1</a>). Hence, the vultures here, being predatory birds of the eagle kind, refer undoubtedly to Christ and His overcomers, who will come as a swift, flying army to war against Antichrist and his armies and destroy them at Armageddon, thus executing God&rsquo;s judgment upon them. This indicates not only that at His appearing, Christ with His overcoming saints will appear in the place where Antichrist is with his armies, but also that Christ with His overcomers will appear swiftly from the air like vultures.
