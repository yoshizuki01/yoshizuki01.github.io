BD["*))\x97"]="<b>Then</b><br> &emsp; The divine revelation in the Bible is progressive, advancing continually from Genesis to Revelation. Genesis reveals God&rsquo;s creation and man&rsquo;s fall, and Exodus reveals God&rsquo;s salvation and the building of God&rsquo;s habitation. As a further advancement of the divine revelation, Leviticus unveils the worship and living of God&rsquo;s redeemed people. While Israel remained with God at Sinai for approximately eleven months (<a href=Exo.htm#v19_1>Exo. 19:1</a>; cf. <a href=Num.htm#v10_11>Num. 10:11</a>), God trained them to worship and partake of Him for their enjoyment and to live a holy, clean, and rejoicing life. This book shows that through the tabernacle, with the offerings, and by the priests, God&rsquo;s redeemed are able to fellowship with God, serve God, and be God&rsquo;s holy people living a holy life, which expresses God. Christ is everything in the fellowship, service, and life of God&rsquo;s people. The worship portrayed in Leviticus is a matter of contacting God by enjoying Christ as the common portion with God and with one another (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v4_24>John 4:24</a> and <a href=JohN.htm#n4_24x1>notes</a>). The issue of enjoying Christ with God is the holy living of God&rsquo;s people."

God sent the flood to exterminate Noah&rsquo;s generation because that generation had become impure. For the sake of the fulfillment of His purpose, God could not allow such a human race to exist."
