BD["a54\x97"]="<b>sanctify</b><br> &emsp; This book unveils to us that God&rsquo;s heavenly calling is to make us a holy people (<a href=Heb.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>), a people sanctified unto God. Christ is the Sanctifier (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_11>2:11</a>). He suffered death on the cross, shedding His blood, and entered the Holy of Holies with His blood (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_12>9:12</a>) that by the heavenly ministry (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_2>8:2</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v8_6>6</a>) of His heavenly priesthood (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_26>7:26</a>) He might be able to do the sanctifying work, and that we might enter within the veil by His blood to participate in Him as the heavenly Sanctifier. By participating in Him in this way, we are enabled to follow Him outside the camp by the sanctifying pathway of the cross. See notes <a href=HebN.htm#n13_12x2>12<sup>2</sup></a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n13_13x1>13<sup>1</sup></a>."
BD["e,+\x97"]="<b>spirit</b><br> &emsp; The spirit of a false prophet, which is actuated by the spirit of deception; such a spirit does not confess that Jesus came in the flesh. This is the spirit of the errors of the Docetists (or, Docetes). This name was derived from the Greek word meaning to seem, to appear to be. The heretical view of the Docetists was that Jesus Christ was not a real man but simply appeared to be; to them He was merely a phantasm. Docetism was intermixed with Gnosticism, which taught that all matter was essentially evil. Hence, the Docetists taught that since Christ is holy, He could never have had the defilement of human flesh. They taught that His body was not real flesh and blood but was merely a deceptive, transient phantom, and thus that He did not suffer, die, and resurrect. Such a heresy undermines not only the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation but also His redemption and resurrection. Docetism was a characteristic feature of the first antichristian errorists, whom John had in view here and in <a href=2Jo.htm#v7>2&nbsp;John 7</a>. The spirit of such errorists is surely not of God. This is the spirit of the antichrist."
BD["a47\x97"]="<b>fall</b><br> &emsp; The grace of God came to us through Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_17>17</a>). Hence, it is also the grace of Christ (<a href=2Co.htm#v13_14>2&nbsp;Cor. 13:14</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v12_9>12:9</a>). In our experience this grace is just Christ Himself (<a href=Gal.htm#v6_18>Gal. 6:18</a>, cf. <a href=2Ti.htm#v4_22>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:22</a>). When we fall from grace we are brought to nought, separated from Christ (<a href=Gal.htm#v5_4>Gal. 5:4</a>). Regarding this matter, Paul warned the churches of Galatia, which were in the same danger as the Hebrew believers, not to be separated from Christ by being turned aside to the law of the Jewish religion, lest they fall away from the grace of God, which is Christ Himself. We should not fall away from grace but should have grace (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_28>v. 28</a>), be confirmed by grace (<a href=Heb.htm#v13_9>13:9</a>), and stand in grace (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_2>Rom. 5:2</a>). Both Galatians and Hebrews close with the blessing of grace (<a href=Gal.htm#v6_18>Gal. 6:18</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v13_25>Heb. 13:25</a>)."

BD["e*1\x97"]="<b>light</b><br> &emsp; Light is the expression of God&rsquo;s essence and the source of truth (see <a href=1JoN.htm#n1_5x3>note 5<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1>ch. 1</a>). The divine love is related to the divine light. It is versus the satanic hatred, which is related to the satanic darkness. Hating a brother in the Lord is a sign of being in darkness (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_11>v. 11</a>). Likewise, loving a brother is a sign of abiding in the light (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_10>v. 10</a>). Love causes us to abide in the light, and light causes us to love the brothers."

BD["d+7\x97"]="<b>count</b><br> &emsp; The mockers count the Lord&rsquo;s long-suffering toward the believers as delay, tardiness, or slackness (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_9>v. 9</a>). This is their twisting of the Lord&rsquo;s word spoken by the prophets in the Scriptures and by the apostles in their teachings (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_16>v. 16</a>). Hence, Peter charged the believers to count the Lord&rsquo;s long-suffering as salvation instead of delay, and not to twist the prophets&rsquo; prophecies or the apostles&rsquo; teachings, including his own and also Paul&rsquo;s, that they might not be judged unto destruction as the heretics will be at the Lord&rsquo;s coming. It is by doing this and being diligent to be found by the Lord in peace, without spot and without blemish (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_14>v. 14</a>), that the believers prepare themselves for the Lord&rsquo;s coming with judgment."

This grace&mdash;the Triune God processed and consummated to be our life supply for our enjoyment (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_16>16</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_17>17</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v13_14>2&nbsp;Cor. 13:14</a>)&mdash;waters us. Hermon, a high mountain, signifies the heavens, the highest place, from which the dew descends. The anointing of the Spirit (<a href=Psa.htm#v133_2>v. 2</a>) and the supply of grace make it possible for us to live in oneness. Cf. <a href=ExoN.htm#n16_13x2>note 13<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v16>Exo. 16</a>."
