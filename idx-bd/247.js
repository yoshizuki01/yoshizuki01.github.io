BD["=.5\x98"]="<b>two</b><br> &emsp; Heb. mahanaim (cf. <a href=Gen.htm#v32_2>Gen. 32:2</a>). Here the Shulammite is likened to two armies, or camps, dancing in celebration of their victory. After he met the angels of God, Jacob divided his wives, children, and the rest of his possessions into two camps, or &ldquo;two armies&rdquo; (<a href=Gen.htm#v32_1>Gen. 32:1</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v32_10>10</a>). The spiritual significance of the two camps as two armies is that we are more than conquerors (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_37>Rom. 8:37</a>). It also signifies a strong testimony. There being two armies indicates that the country girl, the Shulammite, was not alone. An army indicates the principle of the Body of Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_5>Rom. 12:5</a>).<br> &emsp; God does not want those who are strong in themselves. He wants only the feeble ones, the weaker ones, the women and children (cf. <a href=1Co.htm#v1_26>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:26</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v1_28>28</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v12_9>2&nbsp;Cor. 12:9</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v12_10>10</a>). They can become His armies because the fighting is not in their hands but in His. God needs a people who are one with Him, a people who are submissive to Him, signified by the plaited hair (<a href=SoS.htm#v1_11>1:11</a>), and obedient to Him with a flexible will, signified by the neck with strings of jewels (<a href=SoS.htm#v1_10>1:10</a>). Those who are counted worthy to be overcomers will be the weaker ones who depend on the Lord (cf. <a href=Rev.htm#v3_8>Rev. 3:8</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v9_16>Rom. 9:16</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20</a>)."
