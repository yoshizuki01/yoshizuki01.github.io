BD["a,1\x97"]="<b>Sabbath</b><br> &emsp; This Sabbath rest is Christ as our rest, typified by the good land of Canaan (<a href=Deu.htm#v12_9>Deut. 12:9</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v4_8>Heb. 4:8</a>). Christ is rest to the saints in three stages: (1) in the church age, as the heavenly Christ, the One who rests from His work and sits on the right hand of God in the heavens, He is the rest to us in our spirit (<a href=Mat.htm#v11_28>Matt. 11:28</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v11_29>29</a>); (2) in the millennial kingdom, after Satan is removed from this earth (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_1>Rev. 20:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_3>3</a>), Christ with the kingdom will be the rest in a fuller way to the overcoming saints, who will be His co-kings (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>Rev. 20:4</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>), sharing and enjoying His rest; (3) in the new heaven and new earth, after all the enemies, including death, the last enemy, have been made subject to Him (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_24>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:24</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v15_27>27</a>), Christ, as the all-conquering One, will be the rest in the fullest way to all God&rsquo;s redeemed for eternity. But the Sabbath rest mentioned here and typified by the rest of the good land of Canaan covers only the first two stages of Christ&rsquo;s being our rest; it does not include the third stage. The rest in the first two stages is a prize to His diligent seekers, who not only are redeemed but also have enjoyed Him in a full way, thus becoming the overcomers; whereas the rest in the third stage is not a prize but the full portion allotted to all the redeemed ones. Therefore, in the first two stages, and especially in the second, Christ as our rest is the Sabbath rest mentioned here, the rest that remains for us to seek after and enter into diligently. It is in the second stage of His being our rest that Christ will take possession of the whole earth as His inheritance (<a href=Psa.htm#v2_8>Psa. 2:8</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v2_5>Heb. 2:5</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v2_6>6</a>), making it His kingdom for a thousand years (<a href=Rev.htm#v11_15>Rev. 11:15</a>). All His overcoming followers who seek and enjoy Him as their rest in the first stage will participate in His reign in the millennium (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>Rev. 20:4</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>; <a href=2Ti.htm#v2_12>2&nbsp;Tim. 2:12</a>). Moreover, they will inherit the earth (<a href=Mat.htm#v5_5>Matt. 5:5</a>; <a href=Psa.htm#v37_11>Psa. 37:11</a>), some having authority over ten cities, some over five (<a href=Luk.htm#v19_17>Luke 19:17</a>, <a href=Luk.htm#v19_19>19</a>), and will partake of the joy of their Lord (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_21>Matt. 25:21</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v25_23>23</a>). That will be the kingdom rest, which is typified by the rest of entering into the good land of Canaan. The rest of the good land was the goal of all the children of Israel, who had been redeemed and delivered from Egypt; likewise, the rest of the coming kingdom is the goal of the New Testament believers, who have been redeemed and saved from the world. We are now all on the way toward this goal.<br> &emsp; God&rsquo;s full salvation, which He intended for the children of Israel, included redemption through the passover lamb, the exodus from Egypt, feeding on the heavenly manna, having their thirst quenched by the living water from the cleft rock, and partaking of the good land of Canaan. All the children of Israel shared in the passover lamb, the heavenly manna, and the living water, but only Joshua and Caleb, out of those who shared the exodus from Egypt, entered into the good land and partook of it; all the rest fell in the wilderness (<a href=Num.htm#v14_30>Num. 14:30</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v10_1>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:1</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v10_11>11</a>). Though all were redeemed, only the two overcomers, Joshua and Caleb, received the prize of the good land.<br> &emsp; The passover lamb, the heavenly manna, the living water, and the good land of Canaan are all types of different aspects of Christ. According to what is depicted by the experiences of the children of Israel, not all believers who have been redeemed through Christ will partake of Christ as a prize, as their rest, their satisfaction, in both the church age and the coming kingdom; only those who, after being redeemed, seek Christ diligently will partake of Him in such a way. This is why the apostle Paul, though fully redeemed, was still pursuing toward the goal that he might gain Christ as the prize (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_10>Phil. 3:10</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_14>14</a>). In <a href=Phi.htm#v3>Phil. 3</a> Paul told us that he had been in Judaism but that for Christ&rsquo;s sake he had given it up (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_4>Phil. 3:4</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_9>9</a>). Here, in this book, the writer held the same concept, encouraging the Hebrew believers to forsake Judaism and press toward Christ so that they would not miss the prize."

BD[":\x9f7\x97"]="<b>muse</b><br> &emsp; Rich in meaning, the Hebrew word for muse (often translated meditate in the KJV) implies to worship, to converse with oneself, and to speak aloud.

To muse on the word of God is to enjoy His word as His breath (<a href=2Ti.htm#v3_16>2&nbsp;Tim. 3:16</a>) and thus to be infused with God, to breathe God in, and to receive spiritual nourishment."
