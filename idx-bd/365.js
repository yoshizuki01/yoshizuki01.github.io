BD["e-:\x98"]="<b>he</b><br> &emsp; Some teachers say, based on <a href=Joh.htm#v17_15>John 17:15</a>, that he here refers to Christ, who was begotten of God and keeps the regenerated one. But the phrase begotten of God in this clause, a repetition of the phrase in the preceding clause, is the factor that, according to logic, determines that he refers still to the regenerated believer. A regenerated believer (especially his regenerated spirit, which is born of the Spirit of God&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v3_6>John 3:6</a>) keeps himself from living in sin, and the evil one does not touch him (especially his regenerated spirit). His divine birth with the divine life in his spirit is the basic factor of such a safeguard (see <a href=1JoN.htm#n5_4x1>note 4<sup>1</sup></a>)."

Jeremiah enjoyed Jehovah as his portion, and he put his hope not in himself nor in the people nor in anything else but only in Jehovah. On the one hand, Jeremiah realized that God is a God of lovingkindness, that He is compassionate, and that His word is faithful (vv. <a href=Lam.htm#v3_22>22</a>-<a href=Lam.htm#v3_23>23</a>). On the other hand, Jeremiah realized that we still need to contact the Lord every morning, put our entire hope in Him, wait on Him, and call on His name (vv. <a href=Lam.htm#v3_23>23</a>-<a href=Lam.htm#v3_25>25</a>, <a href=Lam.htm#v3_55>55</a>)."
