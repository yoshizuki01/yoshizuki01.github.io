BD[":a)\x97"]="<b>Be</b><br> &emsp; In this psalm David trusted in God and enjoyed God in His salvation, lovingkindness, and faithfulness (vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v57_1>1</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v57_5>5</a>, <a href=Psa.htm#v57_7>7</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v57_11>11</a>). At the same time, he rejoiced at the misfortune of his enemies (<a href=Psa.htm#v57_6>v. 6b</a>). See <a href=PsaN.htm#n54_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Psa.htm#v54>Psa. 54</a>.<br> &emsp; While we are trusting in God and enjoying His care according to His lovingkindness and faithfulness, we need to learn the lessons of God&rsquo;s discipline. We need to find out the reason for the oppositions against us in our environment, for they are God&rsquo;s discipline to correct us, to break us, and to bring us down for our eventual transformation in life (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_5>Heb. 12:5</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v12_11>11</a> and notes <a href=HebN.htm#n12_7x1>7<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n12_10x1>10<sup>1</sup></a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v4_12>1&nbsp;Pet. 4:12</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_19>19</a> and <a href=1PeN.htm#n4_17x1>note 17<sup>1</sup></a>). We should not pray that God would put others down; we are the ones who need to be brought down and broken by God. We should not have the shortage, displayed in many of the psalms, of being devoid of learning the lessons of God&rsquo;s discipline. Cf. <a href=JobN.htm#n2_13x1>note 13<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Job.htm#v2>Job 2</a>."

BD[">S/\x97"]="<b>glory</b><br> &emsp; Israel is God&rsquo;s servant in the sense of fulfilling God&rsquo;s desire in His economy to have a corporate expression of Himself for His glory (<a href=Isa.htm#v41_8>41:8</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v45_4>45:4</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v49_3>49:3</a>). The people of Israel were to be used by God to express Him in a corporate way for His glorification. In this sense Israel was one with Christ as God&rsquo;s servant (<a href=Hos.htm#v11_1>Hosea 11:1</a>; cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v2_15>Matt. 2:15</a>). The servant of Jehovah is corporate, and Israel was part of this corporate servant. See notes <a href=IsaN.htm#n41_1x1>1<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=IsaN.htm#n41_8x1>8<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Isa.htm#v41>ch. 41</a>.<br> &emsp; In the present age the church is the testimony of God in the sense of being one with Christ as God&rsquo;s testimony (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_2>Rev. 1:2</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n1_2x1>note</a>). In being such a testimony, the church serves God. Thus, all God&rsquo;s elect can be considered servants of God with Christ for the expression of God&rsquo;s glory (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v17_22>John 17:22</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v3_21>Eph. 3:21</a>). The glorification of God is the purpose of our service. The highest service we can render to God is to express His glory."

This indicates that the main material in the building of the holy city is jasper. Since jasper signifies God expressed in His transmittable glory (<a href=Rev.htm#v4_3>4:3</a>), the main function of the holy city is to express God in bearing His glory (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_11>v. 11</a>)."
