BD["i8,\x8c"]="And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters; and they became blood."
BD["i3;\x8c"]="And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened, and the Ark of His Covenant was seen in His temple; and there were lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and great hail."
BD["i44\x98"]="<b>great</b><br> &emsp; The dragon is angry because he has been cast down and limited to the earth, thereby losing his territory in the heavens and in the air."
BD["E-\@\x97"]="<b>justice</b><br> &emsp; Instead of Israel&rsquo;s hypocritical worship, God wanted Israel to exercise justice and practice righteousness."
BD["i43\x9b"]="<b>unto</b><br> &emsp; Unto death indicates martyrdom. The overcoming believers who constitute the man-child do not love their soul-life even unto death."
BD["i7/\x8c"]="And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the fury of God, who lives forever and ever."
BD[":\x9f\x9e\x8c"]="You spurn all those who stray from Your statutes, / For their deceitfulness is vain."

BD["i37\x98"]="<b>trumpeted</b><br> &emsp; At the sounding of the seventh trumpet, not only will the great tribulation end, but also this age will close, the mystery of God will be finished (<a href=Rev.htm#v10_7>10:7</a>), and another age, the age of the kingdom, the millennium, will begin."
BD[":U+\x97"]="<b>majesty</b><br> &emsp; Both Christ&rsquo;s majesty and His splendor are signs of His victory. Christ, the mighty One, has overcome all His enemies and has gained the victory (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_8>Eph. 4:8</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v5_5>Rev. 5:5</a>). Splendor is the expression of glory. While Christ was on earth, He showed His splendor only once, when He was transfigured on the mountain (<a href=Mat.htm#v17_1>Matt. 17:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v17_2>2</a>). After His resurrection and ascension, He showed Himself in His splendor and majesty to Paul (<a href=Act.htm#v26_13>Acts 26:13</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v26_15>15</a>) and to John (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_9>Rev. 1:9</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v1_20>20</a>). In His second coming Christ will shine over the earth to illumine it with the splendor of His glory (<a href=Rev.htm#v18_1>Rev. 18:1</a>)."
BD["i62\x8c"]="He also shall drink of the wine of the fury of God, which is mixed undiluted in the cup of His wrath; and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb."
BD["i7+\x98"]="<b>song</b><br> &emsp; The song of Moses, indicating God&rsquo;s triumphant judgment over the enemy of His people, praises God for His judgment, which is on the negative side; whereas the song of the Lamb, indicating Christ&rsquo;s redemption experienced by God&rsquo;s people in the presence of their enemy, praises God for Christ&rsquo;s redemption, which is on the positive side. The late overcomers are positioned to stand on the glassy sea because of two facts: (1) God&rsquo;s judgment over the enemy and (2) Christ&rsquo;s redemption for God&rsquo;s people."

Antiochus Epiphanes persecuted and slew the devoted Jews (vv. <a href=Dan.htm#v11_33>33</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v11_35>35</a>). In this also he typifies Antichrist, who will persecute and kill God&rsquo;s people at the end of this age (<a href=Rev.htm#v13_7>Rev. 13:7</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n13_7x1>note</a>)."

Through His incarnation Christ brought to us the very reality of the universe&mdash;the Triune God, the Divine Trinity, embodied in a person, Jesus Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_17>17</a>). When we realize the embodied reality, the Divine Trinity in Christ, our eyes, our ears, and our understanding are opened, and we have wisdom. Christ is the reality and wisdom to God&rsquo;s redeemed people (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_6>John 14:6a</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v1_24>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:24</a>, <a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>30</a>) that makes them true worshippers of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_23>John 4:23</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v4_24>24</a>)."
