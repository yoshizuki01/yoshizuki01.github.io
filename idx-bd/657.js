Apostasy in the Old Testament denotes giving up God and turning away from God to idols. In the New Testament apostasy is heresy, denoting the denial of Christ&rsquo;s deity; it refers to not believing that Jesus Christ is God incarnated to be a man (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>John 1:1</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>14</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_18>1&nbsp;John 2:18</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_22>22</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v4_2>4:2</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v4_3>3</a>). Apostasy, or heresy, insults God and damages the person of Christ, and division destroys the Body of Christ as Christ&rsquo;s corporate expression. Thus, apostasy and division damage the entire economy of God. Because of this, the apostle Paul charges us to turn away from the divisive ones (<a href=Rom.htm#v16_17>Rom. 16:17</a>), and the apostle John enjoins us to reject the heretical ones (<a href=2Jo.htm#v9>2&nbsp;John 9</a>-<a href=2Jo.htm#v11>11</a>). Like Moses in this book and the apostles in the New Testament, we must be very strict concerning division and apostasy. We must keep the unique oneness of God&rsquo;s people and the unique faith in the person and redemptive work of Christ (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_3>Eph. 4:3</a>, <a href=Eph.htm#v4_13>13</a> and notes <a href=EphN.htm#n4_3x1>3<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=EphN.htm#n4_13x2>13<sup>2</sup></a>)."

They were to worship God in the place of His choice, the place where His name, His habitation, and His altar were (vv. <a href=Deu.htm#v12_5>5</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v12_6>6</a>), by bringing their tithes, offerings, and sacrifices to Him there (vv. <a href=Deu.htm#v12_5>5</a>, <a href=Deu.htm#v12_11>11</a>, <a href=Deu.htm#v12_14>14</a>, <a href=Deu.htm#v12_18>18</a>, <a href=Deu.htm#v12_21>21</a>, <a href=Deu.htm#v12_26>26</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v12_27>27</a>; <a href=Deu.htm#v14_22>14:22</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v14_23>23</a>; <a href=Deu.htm#v15_19>15:19</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v15_20>20</a>). To fulfill these requirements was to have a unique center of worship, as Jerusalem would be later (<a href=2Ch.htm#v6_5>2&nbsp;Chron. 6:5</a>-<a href=2Ch.htm#v6_6>6</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v4_20>John 4:20</a>), for the keeping of the oneness among God&rsquo;s people, thus avoiding the division caused by man&rsquo;s preferences (cf. <a href=1Ki.htm#v12_26>1&nbsp;Kings 12:26</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v12_33>33</a> and <a href=1KiN.htm#n12_27x1>notes</a>).<br> &emsp; The revelation in the New Testament concerning the worship of God corresponds to the revelation in this chapter in at least four ways: First, the people of God should always be one; there should be no divisions among them (<a href=Psa.htm#v133>Psa. 133</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v17_11>John 17:11</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v17_21>21</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v17_23>23</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v1_10>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:10</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v4_3>Eph. 4:3</a>). Second, the unique name into which God&rsquo;s people should gather is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ (<a href=Mat.htm#v18_20>Matt. 18:20</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v1_12>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:12</a> and <a href=1CoN.htm#n1_12x1>notes</a>), the reality of which name is the Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_3>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:3</a>). To be designated by any other name is to be denominated, divided; this is spiritual fornication (see <a href=RevN.htm#n3_8x3>note 8<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v3>Rev. 3</a>). Third, in the New Testament God&rsquo;s habitation, His dwelling place, is particularly located in our spirit, i.e., in our mingled spirit, our human spirit regenerated and indwelt by the divine Spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_6>John 3:6b</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_16>Rom. 8:16</a>; <a href=2Ti.htm#v4_22>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:22</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>Eph. 2:22</a>). In our meeting for the worship of God, we must exercise our spirit and do everything in our spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_24>John 4:24</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v14_15>1&nbsp;Cor. 14:15</a>). Fourth, in our worship of God we must have the genuine application of the cross of Christ, signified by the altar, by rejecting the flesh, the self, and the natural life and worshipping God with Christ and Christ alone (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_24>Matt. 16:24</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20</a>). Hence, the meeting of God&rsquo;s people for the worship of God should be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the mingled spirit as the place of God&rsquo;s habitation, in the place where the cross is, and with the enjoyment of Christ as the reality of the tithes, the offerings, and the sacrifices (see <a href=JohN.htm#n4_24x4>note 24<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=Joh.htm#v4>John 4</a>). This is the oneness of God&rsquo;s people, and this is the proper ground for the worship of God."

It was the God of such glory who appeared to Abraham and called him. His glory was a great attraction to him. It separated (sanctified) him from the world unto God (<a href=Exo.htm#v29_43>Exo. 29:43</a>) and was a great encouragement and strength that enabled him to follow God (<a href=Gen.htm#v12_1>Gen. 12:1</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v12_4>4</a>). In the same principle, God calls the New Testament believers by His invisible glory (<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_3>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:3</a>)."

They were appointed to minister to the Tabernacle of the Testimony and encamp around it to keep it from being touched by the children of Israel (vv. <a href=Num.htm#v1_50>50</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v1_53>53</a>).<br> &emsp; The fighting Israelites were the outward protection for the serving Levites, who were for the testimony of God. The formed Israelites were a type of the church as a corporate warrior fighting the battle for God&rsquo;s testimony (<a href=Eph.htm#v6_10>Eph. 6:10</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v6_20>20</a>). The Levites also typify the church in the aspect of its service to God. For fighting, the believers are a corporate warrior, and for serving, they are the Levites, even the priests (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_9>9</a>)."

The pouring out of God&rsquo;s Spirit was from the heavens in Christ&rsquo;s ascension. The former is the essential aspect of the Spirit in His being breathed into the disciples as life for their living; the latter is the economical aspect of the Spirit in His being poured upon them as power for their work. The same Spirit is within them essentially and upon them economically.<br> &emsp; The pouring out of the Spirit in Christ&rsquo;s ascension was the descension of the resurrected and ascended Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit to carry out His heavenly ministry on the earth to build up His church (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>) as His Body (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>Eph. 1:23</a>) for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy."

This shows that our interceding for others does not depend on our condition; it depends on who we are.

Regardless of our condition, in God&rsquo;s eyes we, God&rsquo;s called ones, are His prophets (<a href=1Co.htm#v14_31>1&nbsp;Cor. 14:31</a>), His new creation (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:17</a>), the members of the Body of Christ (<a href=Eph.htm#v5_30>Eph. 5:30</a>)."

This was the reason that Joshua and all the children of Israel became foolish, proud, and blind in attacking Ai."
