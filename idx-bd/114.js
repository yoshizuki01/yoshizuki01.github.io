BD["X-F\x8c"]="Because we are members of His Body."
BD["X.?\x98"]="<b>love</b><br> &emsp; The reason the apostle inserted love between peace and grace is that the only way we can be kept in a situation of peace is by continually enjoying the Lord in love. Paul realized that love is crucial. He spoke of love in relation to peace and grace, indicating thereby that love is needed to preserve us in a condition of peace.<br> &emsp; Love with faith is the means by which we partake of and experience Christ (<a href=1Ti.htm#v1_14>1&nbsp;Tim. 1:14</a>). Faith is for receiving Him (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_12>John 1:12</a>), and love is for enjoying Him (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_23>John 14:23</a>). Here it is not faith and love nor love and faith, but love with faith. This indicates that we need faith as a match and support for our love. Love with faith is needed. This is the conclusion of the book on the church. The church needs to enjoy Christ in love with faith, which operates through love (<a href=Gal.htm#v5_6>Gal. 5:6</a>). Love comes from God to us, and faith goes from us to God. By means of this traffic of love and faith, peace remains our portion. We are kept in peace by the coming of God&rsquo;s love to us and by the going of our faith to Him. This traffic also keeps us in the continual supply of grace, in the enjoyment of the Lord (<a href=Eph.htm#v6_24>v. 24</a>)."
BD["7)*\x97"]="<b>Jerusalem</b><br> &emsp; The city of Jerusalem was a safeguard and protection for the house of God, which was in the city. This signifies that the house of God as His dwelling and home on the earth needs His kingdom to be established as a realm to safeguard His interests on the earth for His administration, that He may carry out His economy. The rebuilding of the house of God typifies God&rsquo;s recovery of the degraded church, and the rebuilding of the wall of the city of Jerusalem typifies God&rsquo;s recovery of His kingdom. God&rsquo;s building of His house and His building of His kingdom go together (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_19>19</a>). See <a href=PsaN.htm#n42_1x3P2>note 1<sup>3</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=Psa.htm#v42>Psa. 42</a>."
BD["X-B\x98"]="<b>washing</b><br> &emsp; Lit., laver. In Greek the definite article is used before this word, causing it to refer to the laver, the laver that was known to all the Jews. In the Old Testament the priests used the laver to wash away their earthly defilement (<a href=Exo.htm#v30_18>Exo. 30:18</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v30_21>21</a>). Now the laver, the washing of the water, washes us from defilement."

BD["Y,<\x98"]="<b>glory</b><br> &emsp; Glory is God expressed in His splendor and excellency for our appreciation. For glory to be to God means that God is expressed in this way. Our giving in Christ, which is to God for God&rsquo;s interests, brings in God&rsquo;s glory, not only for our enjoyment but also for God&rsquo;s glorification."

BD["Y)E\x98"]="<b>suffer</b><br> &emsp; To suffer on behalf of Christ, after receiving Him and being made one with Him through believing, is to participate in, to have the fellowship of, His sufferings (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_10>3:10</a>) that we may experience and enjoy Him in His sufferings. This is to live Him and magnify Him in a situation in which He is rejected and opposed."

BD[")JE\x97"]="<b>His</b><br> &emsp; Or, his (Moses&rsquo;) speaking with Him (Jehovah); cf. <a href=Num.htm#v7_89>Num. 7:89</a>. Through God&rsquo;s speaking to Moses during his lengthy stay with God, Moses was thoroughly infused with God and saturated with Him. As a result, Moses&rsquo; face shone. According to this chapter, God did not first give Moses the tablets of the law; rather, He first spent time to infuse Moses with Himself by speaking to Moses concerning the enjoyment of Himself (cf. <a href=2Co.htm#v3_3>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:3</a>). Before God gave the law to Moses, God gave Himself to him. This clearly portrays God&rsquo;s intention."

In the case of Israel, this word will be fulfilled at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (<a href=Zec.htm#v12_10>Zech. 12:10</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v11_25>Rom. 11:25</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v11_27>27</a>)."
