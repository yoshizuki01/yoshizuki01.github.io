God&rsquo;s full salvation is based on God&rsquo;s righteousness and is consummated in God&rsquo;s life (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_17>Rom. 5:17</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v5_21>21</a>). Righteousness in God&rsquo;s justice and life through God&rsquo;s light are the two basic factors of God&rsquo;s salvation (<a href=Rom.htm#v1_16>Rom. 1:16</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v1_17>17</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v5_18>5:18b</a>; <a href=Tit.htm#v3_7>Titus 3:7</a>). God&rsquo;s salvation in its two aspects is composed of Christ as the covenant for justification and Christ as the light for life (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_10>Rom. 5:10</a>). Through His death Christ as the covenant satisfies God&rsquo;s righteousness for justification as the base of God&rsquo;s full salvation, and in His resurrection Christ as the light imparts life as the consummation of God&rsquo;s full salvation. Ultimately, the complete salvation of God is embodied in the New Jerusalem, which is a matter of life built on the foundation of righteousness (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>Rev. 22:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v22_2>2</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_14>21:14</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_19>19</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_20>20</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n21_19x1P2>note 19<sup>1</sup>, par. 2</a>).<br> &emsp; Through His death and in His resurrection Christ has become the new covenant as the new testament (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_10>Heb. 8:10</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v8_12>12</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v9_15>9:15</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v9_17>17</a>) according to God&rsquo;s righteousness to be the base of God&rsquo;s full salvation. God gave Christ as a light to the nations that He might be God&rsquo;s salvation to all the world (<a href=Mat.htm#v4_16>Matt. 4:16</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v2_30>Luke 2:30</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v2_32>32</a>). The life of this light (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_4>John 1:4</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v8_32>8:32</a>), as the indestructible life (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_16>Heb. 7:16b</a>), the incorruptible life (<a href=2Ti.htm#v1_10>2&nbsp;Tim. 1:10b</a>), and the real and eternal life that we should lay hold on (<a href=1Ti.htm#v6_19>1&nbsp;Tim. 6:19</a>, <a href=1Ti.htm#v6_12>12</a>), becomes God&rsquo;s salvation to us in His righteousness (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_10>Rom. 5:10</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v5_17>17</a>). This life also ensures us, guarantees us, the heirs of God in His life, the right to inherit God with all His riches as our eternal inheritance (<a href=Act.htm#v26_18>Acts 26:18</a>). Such a life of light grows in us continually, issuing in our church life today (<a href=Eph.htm#v5_8>Eph. 5:8</a>) and consummating in the New Jerusalem in eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>Rev. 21:2</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_9>9b</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_11>11</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_18>18</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_23>23</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>22:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>5</a>)."

Thus, He had to rescue the man whom He had created for His unchanging purpose, even at the cost of sacrificing His only begotten Son (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_16>John 3:16</a>).

While they were making a living in Egypt and were enjoying the pleasures of Egypt, they were usurped and enslaved by Pharaoh to serve him with harshness (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v1_10>10</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v1_14>14</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v2_23>2:23</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v5_6>5:6</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v5_18>18</a>).
