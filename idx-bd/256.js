BD["00>\x97"]="<b>appoint</b><br> &emsp; Samuel turned the age in God&rsquo;s administration from the age of the priesthood to the age of the prophethood with the kingship. This was a great thing not only in the history of Israel but even in the history of mankind. Moses was a priest, and after him God&rsquo;s administration was centered on the priesthood (see <a href=NumN.htm#n27_21x1>note 21<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Num.htm#v27>Num. 27</a>). The priesthood was to minister the word of God to His people and to exercise the authority of God over His people. The Aaronic priesthood failed God in these two things. At the waning of the God-ordained priesthood, God began a new age in raising up Samuel, a young Nazarite, as a faithful priest to replace the waning priesthood (<a href=1Sa.htm#v2_35>2:35</a>). God ministered His word to His elect by establishing Samuel as a prophet in the uplifted prophethood (<a href=1Sa.htm#v3_20>3:20</a>-<a href=1Sa.htm#v3_21>21</a>), and He exercised His authority over His elect by raising up Samuel as a judge (<a href=1Sa.htm#v7_15>7:15</a>-<a href=1Sa.htm#v7_17>17</a>). Samuel, as the last judge, terminated the judgeship, and, as the new priest, brought in the kingship, which was strengthened by the uplifted prophethood, in which Samuel was established as the first prophet (<a href=Act.htm#v3_24>Acts 3:24</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v13_20>13:20</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v11_32>Heb. 11:32</a>). Through Samuel God set up a governmental administration in His economy so that He could fulfill His promises to all the forefathers and accomplish His desire according to His economy, that is, to have a line of genealogy to bring Christ to the earth.<br> &emsp; At the end of his ministry, by the time that Saul was raised up to be the king in Israel (<a href=1Sa.htm#v9_3>9:3</a>&mdash;<a href=1Sa.htm#v10_27>10:27</a>), Samuel had reached the highest position, only God being above him. Thus, as God&rsquo;s representative, Samuel was the acting God. However, God did not have any intention to make a kingdom of Samuel. Rather, God determined to raise up David, through whom He intended to build up a kingdom (<a href=2Sa.htm#v7_12>2&nbsp;Sam. 7:12</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v7_13>13</a>). God had the intention that Christ would be born in the lineage of David. Hence, God raised up Samuel and prepared him for His use to do whatever was necessary to gain, through David, the proper genealogy of Christ. As a Nazarite according to his mother&rsquo;s vow, Samuel had no heart for anything other than God and His elect. He could be used by God to carry out His economy because he was a man according to God and God&rsquo;s heart, having no self-seeking nor any thought of self-gain."

In this aspect of oneness the believers, their self having been fully denied, enjoy the glory of the Father as the factor of their perfected oneness and thus express God in a corporate, built-up way.

David&rsquo;s sin was the issue of his indulging of the lust of the eyes and the lust of the flesh (vv. <a href=2Sa.htm#v11_2>2b</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v11_3>3</a>). David, abusing the power of his kingship (vv. <a href=2Sa.htm#v11_4>4</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v11_5>5</a>), committed willful adultery by robbery. After committing such an act, David tried to cover his evil deed by means of a pretense (vv. <a href=2Sa.htm#v11_6>6</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v11_13>13</a>). Then he murdered Uriah, his faithful servant, by conspiring with Joab, so that he could take Uriah&rsquo;s wife (vv. <a href=2Sa.htm#v11_14>14</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v11_25>25</a>; <a href=2Sa.htm#v12_9>12:9</a>). David&rsquo;s behavior here was utterly different from that of Joseph, who ran and escaped from adultery (<a href=Gen.htm#v39_1>Gen. 39:1</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v39_12>12</a>), and Boaz, who kept himself clean from the indulgence of the flesh of sin (<a href=Rut.htm#v3>Ruth 3</a>). By his one sin David broke the last five of the Ten Commandments (<a href=Exo.htm#v20_13>Exo. 20:13</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v20_17>17</a>). David&rsquo;s sin was a great insult and offense to God, and it nearly annulled all his attainments from the past.<br> &emsp; David, a man according to God&rsquo;s heart (<a href=1Sa.htm#v13_14>1&nbsp;Sam. 13:14</a>), was perfect in every way, but he failed in the matter of the indulgence of the lust of the flesh (<a href=1Ki.htm#v15_5>1&nbsp;Kings 15:5</a>). In this matter David was loose, and he sacrificed his high attainment in the pursuit of God.

The right breast of the ram was first waved before God and then given to Moses as his portion (<a href=Exo.htm#v29_26>v. 26</a>), and both the left breast and the left thigh were heaved up before God and then given to Aaron and his sons, along with the bread, to be their portion (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v29_27>27</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v29_28>28</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v29_31>31</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v29_32>32</a>).<br> &emsp; The fat (<a href=Exo.htm#v29_22>v. 22</a>) signifies the tender and excellent parts of Christ as the portion that is for God, and the right thigh signifies Christ as our strength to stand. The unleavened loaf, the cake of oiled bread, and the wafer (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v29_2>2</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v29_23>23</a>) signify, respectively, Christ as the food that is without sin, Christ as the food that is mingled with the Spirit, and Christ as the food that is available and easy to take in and that is good for feeding the young ones (see <a href=LevN.htm#n2_4x4>note 4<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=Lev.htm#v2>Lev. 2</a>). The putting of all these portions on the palms of Aaron and of his sons, the waving of them as a wave offering, and the burning of them on the altar upon the burnt offering for an offering of consecration (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v29_24>24</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v29_25>25</a>) signifies that the tender, excellent, and strong parts of Christ, with His sinless but Spirit-mingled humanity in different aspects as food, are offered to God in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (waved&mdash;see <a href=ExoN.htm#n29_24x1>note 24<sup>1</sup></a>) as a satisfying and fragrant offering in the fellowship of His sufferings unto death on the cross for our assuming of the New Testament priesthood."
