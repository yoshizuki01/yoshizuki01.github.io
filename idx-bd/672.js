BD["U74\x97"]="<b>no</b><br> &emsp; In this chapter the apostle dealt with the Corinthians&rsquo; heretical saying that there is no resurrection of the dead. The Corinthians were like the Sadducees (<a href=Mat.htm#v22_23>Matt. 22:23</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v23_8>Acts 23:8</a>). This was the tenth problem among them. It is the most damaging and destructive to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, worse than the heresy of Hymenaeus and Philetus concerning resurrection (<a href=2Ti.htm#v2_17>2&nbsp;Tim. 2:17</a>-<a href=2Ti.htm#v2_18>18</a>). Resurrection is the life pulse and lifeline of the divine economy. If there were no resurrection, God would be the God of the dead, not of the living (<a href=Mat.htm#v22_32>Matt. 22:32</a>). If there were no resurrection, Christ would not have been raised from the dead. He would be a dead Savior, not a living One who lives forever (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_18>Rev. 1:18</a>) and is able to save to the uttermost (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_25>Heb. 7:25</a>). If there were no resurrection, there would be no living proof of our being justified by His death (<a href=Rom.htm#v4_25>Rom. 4:25</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n4_25x1>note</a>), no imparting of life (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_24>John 12:24</a>), no regeneration (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_5>John 3:5</a>), no renewing (<a href=Tit.htm#v3_5>Titus 3:5</a>), no transformation (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_2>Rom. 12:2</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_18>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18</a>), and no conformity to the image of Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>Rom. 8:29</a>). If there were no resurrection, there would be no members of Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_5>Rom. 12:5</a>), no Body of Christ as His fullness (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_20>Eph. 1:20</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>23</a>), and no church as Christ&rsquo;s bride (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_29>John 3:29</a>), and therefore no new man (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_15>Eph. 2:15</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v4_24>4:24</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v3_10>Col. 3:10</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v3_11>11</a>).

The first four aspects of such a worthy walk are keeping the oneness, growing up into the Head, learning Christ, and living in love and light. The issue of having these four aspects of a worthy walk is that we are spontaneously filled in our spirit. Out of this inward filling will come submission, love, obedience, care, and all the other virtues of a proper Christian life, church life, family life, and community life.

By means of this two-way traffic the church, as the firstfruits in the universe (<a href=Jam.htm#v1_18>James 1:18</a>), takes the lead to give glory to God.
