This proves that the angels in the preceding verse were the sons of God in <a href=Gen.htm#v6_2>Gen. 6:2</a>, who, putting on human bodies, took humans as wives and committed fornication with different flesh, i.e., with human beings, who are different from angels. The males of Sodom, Gomorrah, and the surrounding cities indulged their lust with males (<a href=Rom.htm#v1_27>Rom. 1:27</a>; <a href=Lev.htm#v18_22>Lev. 18:22</a>), with flesh that was different from what God had ordained, according to the nature of His creation, for human marriage (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_18>Gen. 2:18</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_24>24</a>). By committing fornication with different flesh in this way, they acted in the same manner as the angels in the preceding verse and, consequently, underwent the penalty of eternal fire."

Since Jesus Christ as the Son of God is the very embodiment of God (<a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>), to be in Him is to be in the true God. This indicates that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the true God."

BD["e*E\x9d"]="<b>begotten</b><br> &emsp; John&rsquo;s writings on the mysteries of the eternal divine life stress very much the divine birth (<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_9>3:9</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v4_7>4:7</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_1>5:1</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_4>4</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_18>18</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_12>John 1:12</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_13>13</a>), which is our regeneration (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_3>John 3:3</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v3_5>5</a>). It is the greatest wonder in the entire universe that human beings could be begotten of God and sinners could be made children of God! Through such an amazing divine birth we have received the divine life, which is the eternal life (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_2>1:2</a>), as the divine seed sown into our being (<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_9>3:9</a>). Out of this seed all the riches of the divine life grow from within us. It is by this that we abide in the Triune God and live out the divine life in our human living, i.e., live out the life that does not practice sin (<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_9>3:9</a>) but practices righteousness (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_29>2:29</a>), loves the brothers (<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_1>5:1</a>), overcomes the world (<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_4>5:4</a>), and is not touched by the evil one (<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_18>5:18</a>)."
