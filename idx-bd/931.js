After we have presented our body for the church life, it is very easy for us to fall into the opinions of our mind in our soul, which results in our being damaged in the church life; therefore, our soul, and particularly the mind of our soul, needs to be transformed. However, once our mind is transformed, we may easily fall into a negative and dormant state.

He was crucified with the old creation and buried with it. But He rose from within it, leaving it in the tomb and becoming the firstfruits of the new creation. All the things left in the tomb were a testimony to the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. If these things had not been left there in good order, it would have been difficult for Peter and John to believe (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_8>v. 8</a>) that the Lord had not been taken away by someone but had risen by Himself. These things had been offered to the Lord and wrapped around Him by His two disciples, Joseph and Nicodemus (<a href=Joh.htm#v19_38>19:38</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v19_42>42</a>).

BD["W)9\x97"]="<b>Arabia</b><br> &emsp; It is difficult to trace where in Arabia Paul went and how long he stayed there after his conversion. However, the place must have been away from the Christians, and the time of his stay there must not have been short. His purpose in referring to his stay in Arabia was to testify that he did not receive the gospel from man (<a href=Gal.htm#v1_12>v. 12</a>). In Arabia he must have received some revelation concerning the gospel directly from the Lord."

Undoubtedly, the implication here is that these two evils existed among the Corinthian believers.

In this parenthetical, beseeching word, the apostle described to the Gentile believers his ministry for them, a ministry that he received in the stewardship of grace through the revelation of the mystery of Christ.

As sinners, we need God&rsquo;s forgiveness and justification, as revealed in the book of Romans. But as dead persons, we need to be made alive. Forgiveness and justification bring us back to God&rsquo;s presence to enjoy His grace and participate in His life, whereas being made alive causes us, the living members of the Body of Christ, to express Him. God made us alive by imparting His eternal life, which is Christ Himself (<a href=Col.htm#v3_4>Col. 3:4</a>), into our dead spirit through His Spirit of life (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_2>Rom. 8:2</a>).
