BD["??.\x99"]="<b>righteousness</b><br> &emsp; Israel&rsquo;s evil and wickedness prepared the way for Christ to come in to be their righteousness. Although Israel forsook God for idols (<a href=Jer.htm#v2_13>2:13</a>) and became incurably evil (<a href=Jer.htm#v13_23>13:23</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v17_9>17:9</a>), because of His compassions, lovingkindness, faithfulness, and eternal love (<a href=Jer.htm#v31_3>31:3</a>; <a href=Lam.htm#v3_22>Lam. 3:22</a>-<a href=Lam.htm#v3_23>23</a>), God would never give up His elect yet distracted people. While He was condemning, punishing, and chastising Israel, He intended to be incarnated as a Shoot unto David so that He could be His people&rsquo;s righteousness. Based on Christ&rsquo;s coming as Jehovah to be their righteousness, the evil race of Israel can be restored. Eventually, Israel will manifest Christ, who is their righteousness, as their centrality (their being) and their universality (their expression). This manifestation will consummate in the New Jerusalem (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_12>Rev. 21:12</a>)."
BD["i/1\x9a"]="<b>palm</b><br> &emsp; Palm branches signify the victory of the saints over tribulation, which they have undergone for the Lord&rsquo;s sake (<a href=Rev.htm#v7_14>v. 14</a>; cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v12_13>John 12:13</a>). Palm trees are also a sign of satisfaction gained through being watered (<a href=Exo.htm#v15_27>Exo. 15:27</a>). Palm branches were used for the Feast of Tabernacles, in which the people of God rejoiced because of the satisfaction of their enjoyment (<a href=Lev.htm#v23_40>Lev. 23:40</a>; <a href=Neh.htm#v8_15>Neh. 8:15</a>). The Feast of Tabernacles was a type that will be fulfilled by this great multitude of God&rsquo;s redeemed enjoying the eternal Feast of Tabernacles. In the temple of God this multitude will flourish like the palm tree (<a href=Psa.htm#v92_12>Psa. 92:12</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v92_13>13</a>)."

BD["i+>\x97"]="<b>churches</b><br> &emsp; The seven churches not only signify prophetically the progress of the church in seven ages, as we have seen, but also symbolize the seven kinds of churches in church history: the initial church, the suffering church, the worldly church, the apostate church, the reformed church, the recovered church, and the degraded recovered church. The initial church had its continuation in the suffering church; the suffering church became the worldly church; and the worldly church became the apostate church. Hence, the first four churches issued eventually in one kind of church, that is, the apostate church, the Roman Catholic Church. Then the reformed church, as a reaction to the apostate church, came into existence as another kind of church, a church not fully recovered. Hence, after this, the recovered church was raised up as a full recovery of the proper church life. This can be considered the third kind of church. Through the degradation of the recovered church, the degraded recovered church came into being. This can be counted as the fourth kind of church. These four kinds of churches will all remain until the Lord comes back. Undoubtedly, only the recovered church can fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, and only she is what the Lord is after. We must take the Lord&rsquo;s choice."
