BD["a.-\x97"]="<b>word</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word denotes the instant word of God. The good word of God here refers to the word of the beginning of Christ, which was mentioned in <a href=Heb.htm#v6_1>v. 1</a> and which was the milk the Hebrew believers tasted when they believed in the Lord. Now they had to go on to the deeper word, the word of righteousness (<a href=Heb.htm#v5_13>5:13</a>), which is concerned not mainly with God&rsquo;s redemption but with the way of His economy, and which was the solid food by which they could reach perfection, maturity (<a href=Heb.htm#v6_1>v. 1</a>)."
BD["b)3\x97"]="<b>sun</b><br> &emsp; In <a href=Jam.htm#v1_6>v. 6</a> James used the surge of the sea to illustrate a doubting heart, and in <a href=Jam.htm#v1_10>v. 10</a> he used the flower of the land to portray the fading rich man. Here he used the sun in the heavens with its scorching heat to illustrate the factor that causes man&rsquo;s riches to fade under God&rsquo;s governmental dealing. In <a href=Jam.htm#v1_17>v. 17</a> he used even the turning of the planets to illustrate variableness, which is in contrast to the invariableness of God the Father. In dealing with the problem of our tongue in <a href=Jam.htm#v3_3>3:3</a>-<a href=Jam.htm#v3_12>12</a>, he used twenty kinds of things for illustrations. Moreover, in <a href=Jam.htm#v4_14>4:14</a> he used vapor to portray the brief appearing of our life, and in <a href=Jam.htm#v5_7>5:7</a>-<a href=Jam.htm#v5_8>8</a> he used the farmer&rsquo;s long-suffering to teach us how to await the Lord&rsquo;s coming. James was a wise and experienced man, having not only the experience of human life but also wisdom from the divine source through his seeking by prayer (<a href=Jam.htm#v1_5>v. 5</a>; <a href=Jam.htm#v3_13>3:13</a>, <a href=Jam.htm#v3_17>17</a>). Yet his sympathy for and compromise with Judaism frustrated him from seeing a thorough vision of the wisdom concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, a vision that Paul saw and unveiled in his Epistles. See notes <a href=JamN.htm#n3_12x1>12<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=JamN.htm#n3_17x1>17<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Jam.htm#v3>ch. 3</a>."
BD["c)*\x97"]="<b>Chosen</b><br> &emsp; Both of Peter&rsquo;s Epistles (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_1>2&nbsp;Pet. 3:1</a>) are concerned with the government of God. God&rsquo;s government is universal and deals with all His creatures that He may have a clean and pure universe (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_13>2&nbsp;Pet. 3:13</a>) in order to express Himself. In the New Testament age this dealing begins from His chosen people, His elect, His own household (<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_17>4:17</a>), and especially from His chosen sojourners who are dispersed and are sojourning among the nations, the Gentiles, as His testimony. Hence, these two books emphasize the believers&rsquo; being chosen (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_9>2:9</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v5_13>5:13</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v1_10>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:10</a>). As God&rsquo;s chosen race, God&rsquo;s choice, God&rsquo;s particular possession, the dispersed and chosen sojourners need to see that they are under God&rsquo;s governmental dealing for a positive purpose, regardless of the situation and environment they are in. Anything and everything that happens to them, whether persecution or any other kind of trial or suffering (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_6>v. 6</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v5_9>5:9</a>), is just a part of God&rsquo;s precious governmental dealing. Such a vision will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground them (<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_10>5:10</a>) that they may grow in grace (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_18>2&nbsp;Pet. 3:18</a>)."
BD["a-0\x97"]="<b>obedience</b><br> &emsp; God ordained that Christ should die, and Christ obeyed (<a href=Phi.htm#v2_8>Phil. 2:8</a>). He learned this obedience through the suffering of death."
BD["c))\x9a"]="<b>dispersion</b><br> &emsp; A term familiar to all the Jews scattered among the nations, indicating that this Epistle was written to the Jewish believers. It is from the Greek word that means to scatter or spread abroad; its root means to sow. This implies that the scattered Jews were sown as seeds among the Gentiles."

BD["a,3\x97"]="<b>fall</b><br> &emsp; Since the rest that is covered in this portion of the word is the all-inclusive Christ, to fall from it is to fall from Christ, to be brought to nought from Christ (<a href=Gal.htm#v5_4>Gal. 5:4</a>). In Galatians the danger was that the Galatian believers would drift into the bondage of law from the freedom of grace (<a href=Gal.htm#v5_1>Gal. 5:1</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v5_4>4</a>). Paul advised them to stand fast in the freedom of grace, that is, not to be brought to nought from Christ. Here, in this book, the danger was that the Hebrew believers would not forsake their old religion, which was according to the law, and press on into the enjoyment of Christ as their rest. If they continued to stagger in their old religion, i.e., in Judaism, they would come short of Christ, who was their rest. The writer of this book earnestly encouraged them, as Christ&rsquo;s partners, to press on with Christ and enter into the rest, that they, as His partakers, might enjoy Christ as their rest."

BD["a+6\x97"]="<b>partners</b><br> &emsp; In Greek, the same word as that for partakers in <a href=Heb.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v6_4>6:4</a>; and <a href=Heb.htm#v12_8>12:8</a>. In those three places the meaning is that we share in the heavenly calling, the Holy Spirit, and the discipline; thus, the word is rendered partakers. Here and in <a href=Heb.htm#v1_9>1:9</a> the meaning is that we share with Christ; hence, the word is rendered partners. We are partakers of heavenly, holy, and spiritual things, sharing in the heavenly calling, the Holy Spirit, and the spiritual discipline. We are partners of Christ, sharing with Him the spiritual anointing (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_9>1:9</a>), as the members share the Spirit with the Head, and sharing with Him the heavenly rest, as Caleb shared with Joshua the rest of the good land (<a href=Num.htm#v14_30>Num. 14:30</a>)."

This was done for two purposes, one negative and the other positive. The negative purpose was to destroy for us the devil, who is in the flesh. The positive purpose is to be our merciful and faithful High Priest who has the human nature, that He may sympathize with us in all things."
