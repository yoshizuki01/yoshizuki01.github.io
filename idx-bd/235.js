BD["e-7\x97"]="<b>know</b><br> &emsp; This knowing is based on the fact that after receiving the divine life we abide in the Lord and are one with Him in our praying to God in His name (<a href=Joh.htm#v15_7>John 15:7</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v15_16>16</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v16_23>16:23</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v16_24>24</a>)."

We have such boldness in tranquility to contact God, to fellowship with Him, and to ask of Him, because there is no condemnation of the conscience in our heart. This preserves us in the abiding in the Lord."
BD["a2L\x97"]="<b>will</b><br> &emsp; The will of God here for the Hebrew believers was that they take the new covenant way (vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v10_19>19</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_23>23</a>) and remain with the church (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_25>v. 25</a>), not shrinking back to Judaism (vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v10_38>38</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_39>39</a>) but suffering persecution from Judaism (vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v10_32>32</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_34>34</a>). For this they would receive the promise of a great reward (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_35>v. 35</a>) at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_37>v. 37</a>)."

Not to deny but to confess that the man Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_22>v. 22</a>), is to let the Word of the eternal life abide in us. In so doing we abide in the Son and in the Father and are not led astray by the heretical teachings concerning Christ&rsquo;s person (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_26>v. 26</a>). This indicates that the Son and the Father are the eternal life for our regeneration and enjoyment. In this eternal life we have fellowship with God and with one another (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_2>1:2</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_3>3</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_6>6</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_7>7</a>) and have our being in our daily walk (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_6>v. 6</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_7>1:7</a>)."
