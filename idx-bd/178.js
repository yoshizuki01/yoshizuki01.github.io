This word corresponds with Paul&rsquo;s word in <a href=Rom.htm#v1_3>Rom. 1:3</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v1_4>4</a> concerning Christ as the seed of David being designated the Son of God in His humanity in resurrection (see <a href=RomN.htm#n1_4x1>note 4<sup>1</sup></a> there). It also relates to the Lord&rsquo;s question in <a href=Mat.htm#v22_41>Matt. 22:41</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v22_45>45</a> concerning how the Christ could be both the son of David and the Son of God as David&rsquo;s Lord&mdash;a wonderful person, a God-man with two natures, divinity and humanity. These verses clearly unveil that a seed of man, i.e., a son of man, can become the Son of God. God Himself, the divine One, became a human seed, the seed of a man, David. This seed was Jesus, the God-man, Jehovah the Savior (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_18>Matt. 1:18</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v1_21>21</a>; <a href=2Ti.htm#v2_8>2&nbsp;Tim. 2:8</a>), who was the Son of God by virtue of His divinity alone (<a href=Luk.htm#v1_35>Luke 1:35</a>). Through His resurrection He as the human seed became the Son of God in His humanity as well. Thus, in Christ God was constituted into man, man was constituted into God, and God and man were mingled together to be one entity, the God-man. This implies that God&rsquo;s intention in His economy is to make Himself man in order to make man God in life and in nature.<br> &emsp; In and through resurrection Christ, the firstborn Son of God, became the life-giving Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>). As such a Spirit He enters into God&rsquo;s chosen people to dispense, to build, Himself as life into their being to be their inner constitution. In this way He makes them God-men, the many sons of God (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_10>Heb. 2:10</a>), the mass reproduction of Himself as the firstborn Son of God (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>Rom. 8:29</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_2>1&nbsp;John 3:2</a>). Thus, they, the human seeds, become the sons of God with divinity through the metabolic process of transformation (see notes <a href=RomN.htm#n12_2x3>2<sup>3</sup></a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n12_2x4>2<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=Rom.htm#v12>Rom. 12</a>). This metabolic process is the building up of the church as the Body of Christ and the house of God (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_22>Eph. 1:22</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>23</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_20>2:20</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>22</a>) by the building of God into man and man into God, i.e., by the constituting of the divine element into the human element and the human element into the divine element. This building will consummate in the New Jerusalem as a great, corporate God-man, the aggregate, the totality, of all the sons of God (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_7>Rev. 21:7</a>)."

In <a href=Lev.htm#v14_14>Lev. 14:14</a> the same procedure was used in the cleansing of a leper, indicating that in the eyes of God we sinners who have been ordained to be His priests are unclean, like lepers."

Gold signifies the Triune God with His divine nature, and the shining of the gold signifies the glory of God. The oneness of the boards in the overlaying gold symbolizes the oneness of the believers in the Triune God and in His glory, His expression. This is the practical oneness for which the Lord prayed in <a href=Joh.htm#v17_21>John 17:21</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v17_23>23</a>. This oneness is the building up of the believers to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v14_23>John 14:23</a>)."

That there were three branches on each side of the lampstand signifies resurrection, and the branches themselves signify the branching out of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life. The six branches in two groups of three signify the testimony of the light of life, two being the number of testimony (<a href=Deu.htm#v19_15>Deut. 19:15</a>)."

This indicates that when we serve God, offering Christ to Him as His food, God shares a portion of His food with us. First, we enjoy Christ as the One given to us by God.

The statute of judgment in vv. <a href=Num.htm#v27_8>8</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v27_11>11</a> typifies that the possession of the enjoyment of Christ is based on the relationship in life.

BD["V-<\x98"]="<b>reconciled</b><br> &emsp; In the preceding verse it was the world that was reconciled to God; in this verse it is the believers, who have already been reconciled to God and are to be reconciled further to God. This clearly indicates that two steps are required for men to be fully reconciled to God. The first step is to reconcile sinners to God from sin. For this purpose Christ died for our sins (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_3>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:3</a>) that they might be forgiven by God. This is the objective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. In this aspect He bore our sins on the cross that they might be judged by God upon Him for us. The second step is to reconcile believers living in the natural life to God from the flesh. For this purpose Christ died for us&mdash;the persons&mdash;that we might live to Him in the resurrection life (vv. <a href=2Co.htm#v5_14>14</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v5_15>15</a>). This is the subjective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. In this aspect He was made sin for us to be judged and done away with by God that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. By the two aspects of His death He has fully reconciled God&rsquo;s chosen people to God. These two steps of reconciliation are clearly portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle. The first veil is called &ldquo;the screen&rdquo; (<a href=Exo.htm#v26_37>Exo. 26:37</a>). A sinner who was brought to God through the reconciliation of the propitiating blood entered into the Holy Place by passing this screen. This typifies the first step of reconciliation. The second veil (<a href=Exo.htm#v26_31>Exo. 26:31</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v26_35>35</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v9_3>Heb. 9:3</a>) still separated him from God, who was in the Holy of Holies. This veil needed to be rent that the sinner might be brought to God in the Holy of Holies. This is the second step of reconciliation. The Corinthian believers had been reconciled to God, having passed through the first veil and having entered into the Holy Place. Yet they still lived in the flesh. They needed to pass the second veil, which had been rent already (<a href=Mat.htm#v27_51>Matt. 27:51</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_20>Heb. 10:20</a>), to enter into the Holy of Holies to live with God in their spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v6_17>1&nbsp;Cor. 6:17</a>). The goal of this Epistle was to bring them there that they might be persons in the spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v2_15>1&nbsp;Cor. 2:15</a>), in the Holy of Holies. This was what the apostle meant by saying, &ldquo;Be reconciled to God.&rdquo; This was to present them full-grown in Christ (<a href=Col.htm#v1_28>Col. 1:28</a>)."

But here Christ Himself is our example, since in this section love expressed by Christ to us (vv. <a href=Eph.htm#v5_2>2</a>, <a href=Eph.htm#v5_25>25</a>) and light shined by Christ upon us (<a href=Eph.htm#v5_14>v. 14</a>) are taken as the basic elements."
