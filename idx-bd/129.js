This chapter tells us that this other man, the second man, who is Jesus, has come and has accomplished so much for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s desire in man as revealed in <a href=Gen.htm#v1_26>Gen. 1:26</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v1_28>28</a> and alluded to in <a href=Psa.htm#v8_4>Psa. 8:4</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v8_8>8</a>. Hence, in whatever the first man, Adam, failed, the second man, Christ, succeeded, by replacing the first man.<br> &emsp; This chapter is the fulfillment of the prophecies in <a href=Psa.htm#v8>Psa. 8</a> and <a href=Psa.htm#v22>22</a> concerning the major steps taken by Christ, as a man, to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. In incarnation He partook of human nature (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_14>v. 14</a>). In crucifixion He suffered death for everything (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_9>v. 9</a>) and destroyed the devil (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_14>v. 14</a>). In resurrection He brought forth many sons of God, His brothers, to form the church (vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v2_10>10</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v2_12>12</a>). In exaltation He was crowned with glory and honor. All these steps are the qualifications that qualify Him to be our High Priest (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_17>v. 17</a>)."

At the end of this process He was consummated to be the life-giving Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45b</a>) to be breathed into and poured out upon His believers (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_22>John 20:22</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v2_17>Acts 2:17</a>). Thus, God visited man through the long journey of His process, through which He became the life-giving Spirit to reach man and enter into man to indwell man (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_17>John 14:17</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v14_20>20</a>)."
