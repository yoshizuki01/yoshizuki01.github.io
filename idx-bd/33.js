Before God&rsquo;s initial appearing to Abraham, he and his family served other gods (<a href=Jos.htm#v24_2>Josh. 24:2</a>). It was out of such a dark background of idol worship, the background of Babel (vv. <a href=Gen.htm#v11_3>3</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v11_4>4</a>), that God called Abraham, the father of faith (<a href=Rom.htm#v4_16>Rom. 4:16</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v3_7>Gal. 3:7</a>). God&rsquo;s coming to Abraham and appearing to him brought light to Abraham (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v4_16>Matt. 4:16</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v9_1>Acts 9:1</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v9_3>3</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v4_6>2&nbsp;Cor. 4:6</a>) and motivated him to come out of the country of satanic idolatry.

The transfer of race in God&rsquo;s calling is actually the transfer of life, from the life of Adam to the life of Christ (<a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>Phil. 1:21a</a>), from the fallen life of the old creation to the stronger and better life of the new creation&mdash;the uncreated life of God.

By giving them manna to eat, God indicated that His intention was to change the nature of His people, to change their very constitution, for the accomplishing of His purpose. Because the children of Israel were still constituted with the Egyptian element and were thus the same as the Egyptians, they were not qualified to build up the tabernacle as God&rsquo;s habitation on earth. For forty years God gave the children of Israel nothing to eat but manna (<a href=Exo.htm#v16_35>v. 35</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v11_6>Num. 11:6</a>). This shows that God&rsquo;s intention in His salvation is to work Himself into the believers in Christ and to change their constitution by feeding them with Christ as their unique heavenly food, thereby reconstituting them with Christ in order to qualify them to build up the church as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. In fact, after being reconstituted with Christ, the believers themselves become the dwelling place of God (cf. <a href=1Co.htm#v3_16>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:16</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_17>17</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v6_19>6:19</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v6_16>2&nbsp;Cor. 6:16</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v3_6>Heb. 3:6</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>Rev. 21:2</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>3</a>)."

For Christ to be the Angel of Jehovah means that God has appointed and commissioned Himself in His Divine Trinity to act in caring for His people.<br> &emsp; Because Israel did not act as a proper wife, the very Jehovah who was the Husband, the Head, and the King of Israel became a Servant to His wife.

Since Israel did not regard Jehovah as the Head, He became a Servant to serve her.
