Jehovah means I am who I am (<a href=Exo.htm#v3_14>Exo. 3:14</a>; cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v8_24>John 8:24</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v8_28>28</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v8_58>58</a>), indicating that Jehovah is the self-existing and ever-existing eternal One, the One who was in the past, who is in the present, and who will be in the future forever (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_4>Rev. 1:4</a>)."

BD["(+*\x97"]="<b>said</b><br> &emsp; The outward cause of man&rsquo;s first fall was the serpent&rsquo;s temptation. The inward cause was the woman&rsquo;s assuming the headship (vv. <a href=Gen.htm#v3_2>2</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v3_3>3</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v3_6>6</a>). The woman represents man&rsquo;s position in relation to God. God is man&rsquo;s Husband (<a href=Isa.htm#v54_5>Isa. 54:5</a>); man&rsquo;s position is that of the wife. As the man should be under the headship of God, so the woman should be under the headship of man (<a href=1Co.htm#v11_3>1&nbsp;Cor. 11:3</a>). This is a safeguard against the subtlety of the enemy. Here Eve assumed the headship by speaking to the serpent directly, without the covering of her husband. Thus, she was ensnared by the serpent and was deceived (<a href=1Ti.htm#v2_14>1&nbsp;Tim. 2:14</a>). Eve&rsquo;s failure here typifies man&rsquo;s failure in putting God aside and assuming the headship over God to act independently of Him, thus opening the way for Satan, the subtle one, to deceive man. See <a href=RomN.htm#n7_4x1>note 4<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Rom.htm#v7>Rom. 7</a>."

When man labors in coordination with God&rsquo;s labor, God has the basis to send the rain, signifying His Spirit of life (<a href=Joe.htm#v2_23>Joel 2:23</a>, <a href=Joe.htm#v2_28>28</a>-<a href=Joe.htm#v2_29>29</a>), to mingle with man, the dust of the earth (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_7>v. 7</a>), to produce life."

This is because in the air there are fallen angels (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_2>Eph. 2:2</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v6_12>6:12</a>), and the water is the dwelling place of the demons (<a href=Mat.htm#v12_43>Matt. 12:43</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n12_43x1>note</a>)."
