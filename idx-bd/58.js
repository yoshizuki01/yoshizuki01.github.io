Then, in order to strip Moses of his natural ability, God arranged to have him work as a shepherd in the land of Midian for another forty years (<a href=Exo.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>). God&rsquo;s work to perfect Moses made him a useful vessel for God&rsquo;s purpose.<br> &emsp; According to Exodus, being useful to God is related to building up His dwelling place and to fighting for His interests on earth. Chapters <a href=Exo.htm#v1>1</a> and <a href=Exo.htm#v2>2</a> show that the life useful to God in these matters is the life signified by the female life. In the Bible a male signifies an independent life, whereas a female signifies a life that depends on God (cf. <a href=Luk.htm#v1_26>Luke 1:26</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v1_38>38</a>). The unique male is God in Christ; only He has an independent life. In their relationship to God all God&rsquo;s people, both men and women, are &ldquo;females,&rdquo; components of His wife (<a href=Isa.htm#v54_5>Isa. 54:5</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_29>John 3:29</a>). As such, they must live a life that depends on Him for everything and is under His headship (<a href=Joh.htm#v15_5>John 15:5</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v11_3>1&nbsp;Cor. 11:3</a>). At the age of forty Moses lived an independent life, taking the position of a &ldquo;male&rdquo; before God by exercising his natural strength to strike an Egyptian (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v2_11>11</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v2_12>12</a>). In the second forty years of his life Moses was trained by God not to rely on his natural life, and in his third forty years he lived the life of a &ldquo;female,&rdquo; a life dependent on God. This is the life God can use for the fulfillment of His purpose."
