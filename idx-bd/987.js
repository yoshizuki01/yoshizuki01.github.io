BD["c,,\x97"]="<b>strange</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means to be a host or a guest, to be foreign, alien; to entertain, to lodge; to think it strange. To live in the flesh in the lusts of men (<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_2>v. 2</a>) is common among the unbelieving Gentiles, who are running together into the flood of dissoluteness. But to live a holy life in the will of God, not running together in the indulgence of lusts, is strange to them. It is a foreign thing, alien to them. They are surprised and astonished at it (cf. <a href=1Pe.htm#v4_12>v. 12</a>)."
BD["a02\x97"]="<b>laws</b><br> &emsp; In <a href=Jer.htm#v31_33>Jer. 31:33</a>, the source of this quotation, the word used is law (singular), whereas in this verse it is laws (plural). This proves that it is one law that spreads to become a number of laws. This one law is the law of life (see the law of the Spirit of life&mdash;<a href=Rom.htm#v8_2>Rom. 8:2</a>). Every life has a law. The higher the life, the higher is its law. The divine life that we receive of God is the highest life; therefore, it has the highest law, the law referred to here. By imparting His divine life into us, God puts this highest law into our spirit, whence it spreads into our inward parts, such as our mind, emotion, and will, and becomes several laws.<br> &emsp; The law of life differs from the law of letters. The law of life regulates us from within by and according to its life element, whereas the law of letters regulates us from without by and according to its dead letters. The law of dead letters depends on outward teachings, but the law of life depends on the inward consciousness. Since we all, great or small, have the law of life, we do not need outward teachings that are according to the law of letters (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_11>v. 11</a>)."

BD[":\xa8)\x97"]="<b>Blessed</b><br> &emsp; The sequence of <a href=Psa.htm#v128>Psa. 128</a>&mdash;<a href=Psa.htm#v134>134</a>, the remaining seven Songs of Ascents, is significant. <a href=Psa.htm#v128>Psalm 128</a> speaks of Jehovah&rsquo;s blessing to Israel from Zion and the prosperity of Jerusalem in Israel&rsquo;s enjoyment. <a href=Psa.htm#v129>Psalm 129</a> concerns God&rsquo;s righteous dealing with the persecutors of Israel and the haters of Zion. Because Israel, like their persecutors and haters, has many sins and iniquities, <a href=Psa.htm#v130>Psa. 130</a> is a psalm of forgiveness and redemption. Then <a href=Psa.htm#v131>Psa. 131</a> indicates that after we experience God&rsquo;s forgiveness, we become humble and quiet before God. In such a situation God can rise up, enter into us, and take us as His resting place. This is Zion becoming God&rsquo;s habitation, His resting place, as revealed in <a href=Psa.htm#v132>Psa. 132</a>. Next, <a href=Psa.htm#v133>Psa. 133</a> shows that Zion, God&rsquo;s resting place, is the unique place where the brothers can come together in oneness and receive the commanded blessing of God, even life forever. Finally, in <a href=Psa.htm#v134>Psa. 134</a> the children of Israel first charge the priests to praise God in the night, and then they bless the priests, indicating that the children of Israel, having become Zion, are the highest people, even higher than the priests (cf. <a href=Heb.htm#v7_7>Heb. 7:7</a>)."
BD["c*2\x97"]="<b>Who</b><br> &emsp; This word from <a href=Hos.htm#v2_23>Hosea 2:23</a> was quoted by Paul in <a href=Rom.htm#v9_24>Rom. 9:24</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v9_27>27</a>, in reference first to the Gentiles and then to the remnant of Israel, &ldquo;for not all who are out of Israel are Israel&rdquo; (<a href=Rom.htm#v9_6>Rom. 9:6</a>). Here Peter, quoting this word, referred to the recipients of his letter, the scattered Jewish believers. At one time they were out of Israel but were not Israel. Hence, they were not God&rsquo;s people in the New Testament sense. Now, after being called by God, they became God&rsquo;s people, God&rsquo;s particular possession, as a treasure to God. They were shown God&rsquo;s mercy, which they had never been shown before."
BD["a3)\x97"]="<b>faith</b><br> &emsp; After presenting in the first ten chapters a thorough comparison of Judaism and God&rsquo;s economy, this book charges the Hebrew believers, who were in danger of shrinking back, to live, to walk, to go on, by faith (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_38>10:38</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_39>39</a>), that is, not by appearance (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_7>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:7</a>). Then, in <a href=Heb.htm#v11>ch. 11</a> it goes on to define faith according to the history of faith. Both the eternal inheritance (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_15>9:15</a>) and the great reward (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_35>10:35</a>) promised by God are things hoped for and things not seen. Faith is the substantiation of things hoped for. Hence, it is the assurance, the confidence, the confirmation, the reality, the essence, the supporting ground, of things hoped for, the foundation that supports the things hoped for. Faith is also the conviction of things not seen. It convinces us of what we do not see. Hence, it is the evidence, the proof, of things not seen."
BD["c*1\x9a"]="<b>tell</b><br> &emsp; Or, proclaim abroad. First, we must be born anew and grow in life (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_2>v. 2</a>), and then we must be built up and serve corporately (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>v. 5</a>). Now we need to proclaim abroad, to tell out. To serve corporately is to satisfy God by offering up Christ as spiritual sacrifices; to tell out is to benefit others by proclaiming abroad as the gospel the virtues of the One who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light."
BD["d*)\x97"]="<b>But</b><br> &emsp; After presenting to the believers (in <a href=2Pe.htm#v1>ch. 1</a>) the rich provision of the divine life and the shining enlightenment of the divine truth, thus providing for the maintenance of life and inoculating against the poison of the apostasy, in this chapter the apostle faithfully indicated as a warning to the believers the awful contents of the apostasy and its dreadful result. This warning is a close parallel to the warning given in <a href=Jud.htm#v4>Jude 4</a>-<a href=Jud.htm#v19>19</a>."

The exhortation is spread over the elders in the church in vv. <a href=1Pe.htm#v5_1>1</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_4>4</a>, over the younger members in <a href=1Pe.htm#v5_5>v. 5</a>, and over all in common in vv. <a href=1Pe.htm#v5_6>6</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_11>11</a>."
