In the first three hours He was persecuted by men for doing God&rsquo;s will; in the last three hours He was judged by God to accomplish our redemption. It was during this time that God counted Him as our Substitute who suffered for our sin (<a href=Isa.htm#v53_10>Isa. 53:10</a>). Darkness fell over all the land (<a href=Mat.htm#v27_45>v. 45</a>) because our sin and sins and all negative things were being dealt with there; and because of our sin God forsook Him (<a href=Mat.htm#v27_46>v. 46</a>)."

BD["Z+:\x97"]="<b>Wives</b><br> &emsp; The section from this verse through <a href=Col.htm#v4_1>4:1</a> is a sister passage to <a href=Eph.htm#v5_22>Eph. 5:22</a>&mdash;<a href=Eph.htm#v6_9>6:9</a>, regarding the believers&rsquo; ethical relationships. In Ephesians the emphasis is on the need of having spirit-filled ethical relationships for the expression of the Body of Christ in the normal church life. In Colossians the emphasis is on our holding Christ as our Head and taking Him as our life by having His rich word dwell in us, that the highest ethical relationships, issuing not from our natural life but from Christ as our life, may be realized for His expression.<br> &emsp; For each point in this passage, see the appropriate note in Ephesians."
BD["U8\@\x97"]="<b>love</b><br> &emsp; Not a natural love but love in Christ, love in resurrection (<a href=1Co.htm#v4_21>4:21</a>), the love of God that becomes ours through the grace of Christ and the fellowship of the Spirit (<a href=2Co.htm#v13_14>2&nbsp;Cor. 13:14</a>). Of Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles, only this one ends with such a word of the assurance of love. This is because the apostle had been dealing with them with strong rebukes (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_13>1:13</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v3_3>3:3</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v4_7>4:7</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v4_8>8</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v5_2>5:2</a>, <a href=1Co.htm#v5_5>5</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v6_5>6:5</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v6_8>8</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v11_17>11:17</a>). He was faithful, honest, and frank toward them in the love of God in Christ (<a href=2Co.htm#v2_4>2&nbsp;Cor. 2:4</a>), without being political. Hence, the Lord honored his dealings, and the Corinthians accepted his rebukes and repented, resulting in their being benefited (<a href=2Co.htm#v7_8>2&nbsp;Cor. 7:8</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v7_13>13</a>)."
