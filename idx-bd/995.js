But if a sinner blasphemes the Spirit, the Spirit will have no ground to work on him, and there will be no one left to cause him to repent and believe.

Undoubtedly, the Jews&rsquo; opposition was instigated by Satan to frustrate God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. But the ground used by Satan for his instigation was the change of dispensation, which contradicted the Judaic traditions. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to have a new dispensation absolutely separated from Judaism. This offended the Jews by touching the traditions they had inherited for generations, and it stirred up their opposition, which began with the Lord&rsquo;s ministry in the Gospels and grew more fierce at the time of the apostles&rsquo; ministry in this book, during which the Lord&rsquo;s New Testament move was passing through a transitional period. According to Luke&rsquo;s narration in Acts, the church among the Jews, including the early apostles, did not pass through this transition successfully, because of the remaining influence of their Judaic background and the entangling opposition from their Jewish kinsmen. This problem returned to trouble them again and again in this book (<a href=Act.htm#v11_1>11:1</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v11_3>3</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v15_1>15:1</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v15_5>5</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v21_18>21:18</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v21_26>26</a>).
