BD[":Z-\x97"]="<b>covenant</b><br> &emsp; To make a covenant with God by sacrifice is to make a covenant by Christ as our sacrifice (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_5>Heb. 10:5</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v10_10>10</a>) and as the Mediator between us and God (<a href=1Ti.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Tim. 2:5</a>)."

It is not only the resurrection of life (<a href=Joh.htm#v5_29>John 5:29</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v15_23>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:23b</a>; <a href=1Th.htm#v4_16>1&nbsp;Thes. 4:16</a>) but also the resurrection of reward (<a href=Luk.htm#v14_14>Luke 14:14</a>), the out-resurrection, i.e., the outstanding resurrection, which the apostle Paul sought (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_11>Phil. 3:11</a>), the resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcomers, which enables them to reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom (vv. <a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>4</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>). Hence, blessed is he who has part in the first resurrection (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>v. 6</a>)."

BD["i;0\x98"]="<b>righteousnesses</b><br> &emsp; Or, righteous acts. The righteousnesses (plural) here are not the righteousness (i.e., Christ) that we received for our salvation (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>). The righteousness we received for our salvation is objective and enables us to meet the requirement of the righteous God, whereas here the righteousnesses of the overcoming saints are subjective (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_9>Phil. 3:9</a>) and enable them to meet the requirement of the overcoming Christ. In <a href=Psa.htm#v45_13>Psa. 45:13</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v45_14>14</a> the queen has two garments: one corresponds with the objective righteousness, which is for our salvation, and the other with the subjective righteousnesses, which are for our victory. The second garment is equivalent to the wedding garment in <a href=Mat.htm#v22_11>Matt. 22:11</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v22_12>12</a>."

BD[">O*\x97"]="<b>his</b><br> &emsp; Hezekiah&rsquo;s showing the visitors from Babylon his treasury, his whole armory, and everything in his dominion was a foolish act and a great mistake. The showing of these riches became a temptation to Babylon. A little over one hundred years later, the king of Babylon came and took away those riches (<a href=2Ki.htm#v24>2&nbsp;Kings 24</a>&mdash;<a href=2Ki.htm#v25>25</a>). Hezekiah did not consider his action carefully, nor did he pray about it. He did not take thought concerning what the king of Babylon might do. This shows that Hezekiah was hasty and not very considerate or careful. Furthermore, his making a show offended God, who hates man&rsquo;s pride (<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 5:5</a>)."
BD["J+*\x97"]="<b>revive</b><br> &emsp; In his prayer for revival, Habakkuk represents all God&rsquo;s elect throughout the generations. Among God&rsquo;s elect there has always been an aspiration to be revived. Moreover, since the fall of man there has been in all creation an aspiration for revival (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_19>Rom. 8:19</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_23>23</a>). Adam&rsquo;s fall brought corruption, slavery, and death into the whole creation (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_12>Rom. 5:12</a>); everything is decaying and is under the slavery of corruption. All the things that are under this slavery aspire to be revived.<br> &emsp; The universal need for revival, for restoration, can be met only by Christ and in Christ. Only Christ, who was resurrected on the third day (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_4>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:4</a>), is the renewing power. For the whole universe and for all mankind, Christ is the reality of the third day (<a href=Joh.htm#v11_25>John 11:25</a>). The reality of the third day is the person of the resurrected Christ with the reality of revival. Christ, therefore, is the element of the revival for which all creation aspires. The corruption and desolation can be swallowed up only by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. The way to experience revival is to contact Christ by repenting and confessing our sins, failures, and darkness, thereby entering into Him as the resurrection. Cf. <a href=Hos.htm#v6_2>Hosea 6:2</a> and <a href=HosN.htm#n6_2x1>note</a>."

BD[">N-\x97"]="<b>fifteen</b><br> &emsp; For God to give Hezekiah another fifteen years meant that he would live until the age of only fifty-four (<a href=2Ki.htm#v18_2>2&nbsp;Kings 18:2</a>). The reason God extended Hezekiah&rsquo;s life by only fifteen years was that, in the sight of God, Hezekiah was not a person who could be trusted to carry out God&rsquo;s purpose. During his last fifteen years Hezekiah made a mistake that was so serious that it caused God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth to be lost (<a href=Isa.htm#v39>ch. 39</a>)."
BD["i96\x98"]="<b>chosen</b><br> &emsp; Chosen is mentioned after called. To be called is to be saved, whereas to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord by virtue of an overcoming life. Today many are called, but in the future few will be chosen (<a href=Mat.htm#v22_14>Matt. 22:14</a>)."
