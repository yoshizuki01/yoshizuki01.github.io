God used one kind of locust to deal with another kind of locust in order to preserve Israel that Christ might have a channel&mdash;the reserved and preserved Israel&mdash;through which to be brought forth."

The first thing announced is the coming of John the Baptist (vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v40_3>3</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v40_4>4</a>). This is followed immediately by the appearing of Christ, the One recommended by John, as the glory of Jehovah (<a href=Isa.htm#v40_5>v. 5</a>). The glory of Jehovah is the center of the gospel for the new creation (<a href=2Co.htm#v4_4>2&nbsp;Cor. 4:4</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v4_6>6</a>). Christ is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_3>Heb. 1:3</a>), and this effulgence is like the shining of the sun (<a href=Luk.htm#v1_78>Luke 1:78</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v1_79>79</a>). Thus, when Christ appeared, the glory of Jehovah was revealed to be seen by the God-seekers and Christ-believers (<a href=Mat.htm#v17_1>Matt. 17:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v17_2>2</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v17_5>5</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v2_25>Luke 2:25</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v2_32>32</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v9_32>9:32</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v1_16>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:16</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_18>18</a>). To those on whom Christ has shined, Christ is the glory of God and the hope of glory within them (<a href=Col.htm#v1_27>Col. 1:27</a>).<br> &emsp; In this chapter the coming Christ as the glad tidings is to be announced as Jehovah our God (<a href=Isa.htm#v40_3>v. 3</a>); as Jehovah of glory (<a href=Isa.htm#v40_5>v. 5</a>); as the Lord Jehovah coming with might to rule with His arm, having His reward with Him and His recompense before Him (vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v40_9>9</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v40_10>10</a>); and as a Shepherd feeding His flock, gathering the lambs in His arms, carrying them in His bosom, and leading those who are nourishing the young (<a href=Isa.htm#v40_11>v. 11</a>)."

BD[">O0\x97"]="<b>my</b><br> &emsp; Hezekiah&rsquo;s response to Isaiah&rsquo;s word indicates that he was selfish, caring only for himself. The kingdom of Judah, over which Hezekiah became king, was actually God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth, and Hezekiah should not have regarded it as his own kingdom (cf. <a href=1SaN.htm#n31_6x1>note 6<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=1Sa.htm#v31>1&nbsp;Sam. 31</a>). For Hezekiah to lose his kingdom was a small thing, but for God to lose His kingdom was a great thing. Hezekiah&rsquo;s response in this verse indicates that he had no thought for God and God&rsquo;s kingdom, nor did he care even for his own children. He was altogether for himself.<br> &emsp; The factors of Hezekiah&rsquo;s failure include (1) making a show of what he had, according to his flesh, (2) not being watchful, (3) not seeking the Lord, (4) not praying, (5) not considering the result of his actions, and (6) caring only for himself and not for God&rsquo;s kingdom on the earth."
