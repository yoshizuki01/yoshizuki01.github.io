The two are similar, but the conclusion in this psalm is improved by the mentioning of God&rsquo;s glorious name and the filling of the whole earth with His glory because of the gaining of the earth through the enjoyment of God in His house and His city (see <a href=PsaN.htm#n68_29x1>note 29<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Psa.htm#v68>Psa. 68</a>)."
