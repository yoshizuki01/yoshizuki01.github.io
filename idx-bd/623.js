She is like smoke, but she is a pillar that can stand on the earth and touch the heavens.

Our spirit contacts, receives, contains, and experiences God. However, this requires that our heart love God first. Our soul is of three parts&mdash;mind, will, and emotion; and our spirit too is of three parts&mdash;conscience, fellowship, and intuition. Our heart is not separate from our soul and spirit but is a composition of all the parts of our soul, plus the conscience, a part of our spirit. Hence, in our heart is the mind, with the thoughts, and the will, with the intentions. The thoughts affect the intentions, and the intentions carry out the thoughts. The living word of God is able to discern the thoughts in our mind and the intentions in our will. What was quoted from the word of God by the writer in the foregoing verses was able to expose what and where the thoughts and intentions of the Hebrew believers were while they were staggering in the process of their salvation."
