The middle portion, the holy heave offering, is a square of twenty-five thousand reeds (<a href=Ezk.htm#v48_20>v. 20</a>) and is divided into three strips: one part for the priests and the temple (vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v48_8>8</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v48_12>12</a>), one part for the Levites (vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v48_13>13</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v48_14>14</a>), and one part for the city with all its workers (vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v48_15>15</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v48_20>20</a>).

The nearness of the tribes to Christ is determined by their importance. The most important are the priests, who are the closest to Christ and who maintain the fellowship between the people and the Lord. The Levites, who maintain a service to the Lord, are next in nearness to the Lord. Then the workers for the city, who maintain God&rsquo;s government, are the third closest to the Lord. In addition, there is the royal family with the king and the kingship.<br> &emsp; The fellowship of the priests, the service of the Levites, the work to maintain God&rsquo;s government, and the kingship all come out of the riches of the land. According to spiritual significance, this means that in the church all the fellowship, service, work, government, royalty, lordship, and kingship come out of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. The more we enjoy Christ, the closer we are to Him, and the closer we are to Him, the more important we are in His purpose. The most important are the priests and the kings. According to the New Testament revelation, all the New Testament believers should exercise to be priests and kings (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_9>9</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v1_6>Rev. 1:6</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v5_10>5:10</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>20:6</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_3>22:3b</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>5</a>)."
