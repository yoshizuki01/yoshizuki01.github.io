The degraded recovered church has the knowledge of the doctrines concerning Christ but not much living faith to partake of the divine element of Christ. She needs to pay the price to gain the golden faith through the fiery trials that she may participate in the real gold, which is Christ Himself as the life element to His Body. Thus she can become a pure golden lampstand (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_20>1:20</a>) for the building of the golden New Jerusalem (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_18>21:18</a>)."

The restoration will include not only Israel but also the whole human race, the earth, and the entire universe. The purpose of the restoration is to restore the God-created and fallen universe, which was defiled and polluted by two rebellions: the rebellion of Satan and the angels who followed him (<a href=Isa.htm#v14_12>Isa. 14:12</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v14_15>15</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v12_4>Rev. 12:4a</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v12_9>9</a>) and the rebellion of man (<a href=Gen.htm#v3_1>Gen. 3:1</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v3_6>6</a>).
