Being spirits, the unclean spirits should be in the heavenlies, but having become frogs, they can move about only on the earth. This indicates that Satan and his power to act will be confined to the earth."

Those five are Julius Caesar, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, all of whom either were murdered or committed suicide before John wrote this book. The sixth, Domitian, who was also murdered, was living when this book was written; therefore, it is said of him that he &ldquo;is.&rdquo; &ldquo;The other,&rdquo; the seventh, is Antichrist; he had &ldquo;not yet come&rdquo; at that time. When he comes, he will remain only a short time and then will be slain and will be resuscitated by the spirit of the fifth, who is Nero, to become the eighth."
