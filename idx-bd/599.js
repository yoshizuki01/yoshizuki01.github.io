Satan wanted to exalt himself to the uttermost parts of the north (<a href=Isa.htm#v14_13>v. 13</a>), but God judged the rebellious Satan, sentencing him to be cast from the heavens to the earth and into Sheol, to the uttermost parts of the pit (vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v14_12>12</a>, <a href=Isa.htm#v14_15>15</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v28_17>Ezek. 28:17</a>).

Because Satan&rsquo;s rebellion polluted not only the earth but also the heavens (see notes <a href=ColN.htm#n1_20x5>20<sup>5</sup></a> in <a href=Col.htm#v1>Col. 1</a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n9_23x1>23<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v9>Heb. 9</a>), both the earth and the heavens were judged by God. As a result, the sun and the stars did not shine, and the earth was covered with darkness and buried under deep water (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_2>Gen. 1:2</a>; <a href=Job.htm#v9_5>Job 9:5</a>-<a href=Job.htm#v9_7>7</a>).<br> &emsp; According to <a href=Rev.htm#v12_4>Rev. 12:4a</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v12_9>9b</a>, one-third of the angels of heaven joined Satan in his rebellion. They too must have been judged by God (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v25_41>Matt. 25:41</a>), and after being judged they became the fallen angels, Satan&rsquo;s subordinates as the rulers, the authorities, the world-rulers of this darkness, the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies (<a href=Eph.htm#v6_12>Eph. 6:12</a> and <a href=EphN.htm#n6_12x2>note 2</a>; see <a href=DanN.htm#n10_11x1>note 11<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Dan.htm#v10>Dan. 10</a>). The living creatures on the earth in the preadamic age also joined Satan in his rebellion. After being judged by God through water (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_2>Gen. 1:2</a>), they became disembodied spirits, the demons (<a href=Mat.htm#v8_28>Matt. 8:28</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v8_32>32</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v12_43>12:43</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v12_45>45</a>), who lodge in the water with which they were judged (see notes <a href=MatN.htm#n8_32x2>32<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v8>Matt. 8</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n21_1x3>1<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v21>Rev. 21</a>) and work on earth for Satan&rsquo;s kingdom of darkness (<a href=Mat.htm#v12_26>Matt. 12:26</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v26_18>Acts 26:18a</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v1_13>Col. 1:13a</a>)."

When Moses and Elijah appeared with Christ on the mount of transfiguration (<a href=Mat.htm#v17_3>Matt. 17:3</a>), Moses must have been manifested in his body, which had been kept by the Lord and resurrected. In view of this, probably, the devil attempted to do something to Moses&rsquo; body, and the archangel argued with him concerning this.

According to His nature and disposition the Lord Jesus on the throne has the appearance of electrum, signifying the redeeming God. The lower part of a man&rsquo;s body is for moving. The appearance of fire from the loins downward signifies the Lord&rsquo;s appearance in His move with God&rsquo;s burning and sanctifying power (see <a href=EzkN.htm#n1_4x4>note 4<sup>4</sup></a>).<br> &emsp; When the Lord comes to us, He comes as fire to enlighten, search, and burn.
