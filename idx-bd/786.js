Although this psalm does not mention Christ or the Messiah, the very God who judges (<a href=Psa.htm#v75_7>v. 7</a>) must be Christ, for God has given all judgment to Christ the Son (<a href=Joh.htm#v5_22>John 5:22</a>). Christ, the second of the Divine Trinity, is the One who will execute judgment upon all sinners (<a href=Act.htm#v10_42>Acts 10:42</a>). Here the judgment is upon the desolators, who had gone too far in executing God&rsquo;s judgment on His people (see <a href=IsaN.htm#n26_13x1P1>note 13<sup>1</sup>, par. 1</a>, in <a href=Isa.htm#v26>Isa. 26</a>)."

There the people believed into the Lord because they saw the miracles He performed. The Lord could not commit Himself to such people. But the case in this chapter concerns life in regeneration; it reveals that this book is not for miraculous things but is only for life. This is why in this book even the miracles done by the Lord are called signs, signifying that the Lord came for life so that God might be multiplied (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_24>12:24</a>), not for miracles so that man might be benefited."
