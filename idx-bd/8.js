The heave offering typifies the uplifted Christ, the Christ who was lifted up in His ascension (<a href=Act.htm#v1_9>Acts 1:9</a>); it was often accompanied by the wave offering, a type of the resurrected Christ (<a href=Exo.htm#v29_26>29:26</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v29_28>28</a>; <a href=Lev.htm#v7_30>Lev. 7:30</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v7_32>32</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v18_11>Num. 18:11</a>). The fact that the materials for the building of the tabernacle were offered to God by His people as a heave offering signifies that the church is built up not with any natural materials but with the very Christ who has been gained, possessed, enjoyed, and experienced by God&rsquo;s people in resurrection and in the heavenlies (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_7>Phil. 3:7</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_14>14</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v3_8>Eph. 3:8</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_5>2:5</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_6>6</a>).

The redeeming life is for the generating life, and the generating life is for the building life. The fact that minerals were mentioned as the first category indicates that whatever Christ is and whatever He has done and is doing are all for God&rsquo;s building (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>). In the New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s building, there will be only minerals: gold, pearl, and precious stones (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_18>Rev. 21:18</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_21>21</a>).

BD["O4H\x98"]="<b>age</b><br> &emsp; In God&rsquo;s governmental administration His forgiveness is dispensational. For His administration He has planned different ages. The period from the first coming of Christ to eternity is divided dispensationally into three ages: (1) this age, the present one, from Christ&rsquo;s first coming to His second coming; (2) the coming age, the millennium, the one thousand years for restoration and heavenly reigning, from Christ&rsquo;s second coming to the end of the old heaven and old earth; and (3) eternity, the eternal age of the new heaven and new earth. God&rsquo;s forgiveness in this age is for sinners&rsquo; eternal salvation. This forgiveness is given to both sinners and believers. God&rsquo;s forgiveness in the coming age is related to the believers&rsquo; dispensational reward. If after being saved a believer commits a sin but will not make a clearance through confession and the cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_7>1&nbsp;John 1:7</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_9>9</a>) before he dies or the Lord comes back, the sin will not be forgiven in this age but will remain and will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_10>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:10</a>). In such a case, the believer will not be rewarded with the kingdom, i.e., will not participate with Christ in the glory and joy in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, but will be disciplined so that the sin is cleared, and will be forgiven in the coming age (<a href=Mat.htm#v18_23>18:23</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v18_35>35</a>).

BD["+90\x97"]="<b>budded</b><br> &emsp; A rod is a piece of dead wood that has not only been cut but is also dried up. Yet such a dead and dried-up piece of wood budded! A bud is something organic, something of life. The budding rod of Aaron typifies not a dead Christ but the resurrected Christ, the budding Christ, who not only buds but also blossoms and bears fruit to maturity. Such a Christ imparts life to others (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_24>John 12:24</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:3</a>).
