Then he left Troas and went forth to Macedonia (<a href=2Co.htm#v2_13>v. 13</a>), being anxious to meet Titus to obtain the information. This showed his great affection for the Corinthians.

Here the Lord likened the evil generation of the rejecting Jews to the demon-possessed man. In the eyes of the Lord the rejecting Jews were like the demon-possessed people. The signs of Jonah and Solomon indicated that the Gentiles would repent, but the case of the demon-possessed man indicated that the rejecting Jews would not repent. They would only sweep away the dirt and decorate by adding good things to beautify themselves. They would not receive Christ and allow Him to fill them. Rather, they would remain empty and unoccupied. This is the actual condition of today&rsquo;s Jews.
