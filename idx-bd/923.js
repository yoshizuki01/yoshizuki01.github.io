BD["e-.\x9a"]="<b>testifies</b><br> &emsp; The Spirit, who is the truth, the reality (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_16>John 14:16</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v14_17>17</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v15_26>15:26</a>), testifies that Jesus is the Son of God, in whom is the eternal life. By thus testifying, He imparts the Son of God into us to be our life (<a href=Col.htm#v3_4>Col. 3:4</a>)."
BD["e,2\x97"]="<b>Herein</b><br> &emsp; Referring to the following fact: it is not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins. In this fact is the higher and nobler love of God."
BD["a4>\x97"]="<b>Mount</b><br> &emsp; The things mentioned in vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v12_22>22</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v12_24>24</a> are heavenly and spiritual, in contrast to the earthly and physical things listed in vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v12_18>18</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v12_19>19</a>. These things signify the side of grace, where both the firstborn and the spirits of righteous men are saved by grace. The people under the old covenant came to the side of the law, whereas we Christians, who are under the new covenant, come to the side of grace. Hence, we are not under the law but under grace (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_14>Rom. 6:14</a>). This portion of the word (vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v12_18>18</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v12_24>24</a>), like <a href=Gal.htm#v4_21>Gal. 4:21</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v4_31>31</a>, shows us that we are not under the bondage of the law but under the freedom of grace to be the heirs of the inheritance. This is our birthright! We should not give this up by falling away from grace (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_15>v. 15</a>), but should have grace (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_28>v. 28</a>). The things on the side of grace are heavenly, but not all are in heaven yet. A great number of the firstborn of the church are still on earth, while the spirits of righteous men, who are the Old Testament saints, are in Paradise, where Abraham is (<a href=Luk.htm#v16_22>Luke 16:22</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v16_23>23</a>, <a href=Luk.htm#v16_25>25</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v16_26>26</a>) and where the Lord Jesus and the saved robber went after they died on the cross (<a href=Luk.htm#v23_43>Luke 23:43</a>).<br> &emsp; None of the six items listed on the side of the law is pleasant. First, there is a mountain set on fire. Who would approach such a place? Then there are the darkness, the gloom, and the stormy whirlwind. Last, there are the terrifying sound of a trumpet and the solemn, warning voice of words. All these present a fearsome sight. On the side of grace, however, everything is pleasant. The eight items here can be considered four pairs. The elevated Mount Zion and the beautiful heavenly Jerusalem are the first pair, denoting God&rsquo;s habitation and the center of His universal administration. What a lovely place! The celebrating, jubilant angels, so closely related to the heirs of salvation to whom they minister (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_14>1:14</a>), and the blessed firstborn of the church form the second pair in the scene. What a joyful demonstration of an angelic gathering! They celebrate the participation by the human heirs of salvation, the church of the firstborn, in the blessings of the new covenant. God, the Judge of all, and the spirits of righteous men, the Old Testament saints (their bodies, not resurrected, were not worthy to be listed in this portion) are linked as the third pair, showing that God, being righteous, justifies the righteous saints of old because of their faith. The dear Lord Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, which is a better covenant, and His precious sprinkled blood, which speaks something better, compose the last pair, indicating that a better covenant was enacted with Jesus&rsquo; better blood, that Jesus died and bequeathed this new covenant as a new testament to His believers, and that He is now the Mediator, the Executor, of this new testament, bringing about the full realization of all the blessed facts contained within it. What a pleasant scene! What a contrast to the scene on the side of the law, where no God, no Savior, and even no angels are mentioned! It is no wonder that not one saved person is seen there. In the scene of grace there is the justifying God, the Savior, who is the Mediator of His new testament, with His speaking blood, the ministering angels with the assembly (the church) of the saved ones, and the spirits of the justified saints. On the side of the law the scene ends with the terrifying sound of a trumpet and the warning words. On the side of grace the scene ends with a sympathizing Mediator and a vindicating speaking. After seeing such a contrast, who would be so foolish as to leave the side of grace and turn to the side of the law? All eight items on the side of grace are not only heavenly and spiritual but also eternal. Hence, even when heaven is shaken (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_26>v. 26</a>), these eight items that are eternal will still remain (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_27>v. 27</a>)."

To know the Father is the initial issue of being regenerated (<a href=Joh.htm#v17_3>John 17:3</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v17_6>6</a>). Hence, such an experiential knowledge in the youth of the divine life is the basic qualification of the young children, who are the youngest in John&rsquo;s classification."
