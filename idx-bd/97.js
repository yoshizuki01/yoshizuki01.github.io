BD["(4)\x97"]="<b>Now</b><br> &emsp; After the death of Abraham&rsquo;s father (<a href=Gen.htm#v11_32>11:32</a>), God appeared to Abraham and called him the second time (see <a href=GenN.htm#n11_31x1>note 31<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v11>ch. 11</a>). God&rsquo;s repeated appearing to Abraham was a strong attraction to him, motivating and strengthening him to accept God&rsquo;s calling. It is the same with the New Testament believers (see notes <a href=MatN.htm#n4_20x1>20<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n4_22x1>22<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v4>Matt. 4</a>, <a href=MatN.htm#n9_9x3>9<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v9>Matt. 9</a>, <a href=HebN.htm#n12_2x2>2<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v12>Heb. 12</a>, and <a href=2PeN.htm#n1_3x8>3<sup>8</sup></a> in <a href=2Pe.htm#v1>2&nbsp;Pet. 1</a>).<br> &emsp; The records of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (with Joseph&mdash;see <a href=GenN.htm#n37_2x1>note 2<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v37>ch. 37</a>) overlap. Genesis does not portray them as three separate individuals but as constituents of one corporate person. The experiences of these three men portray different aspects of one complete person&rsquo;s experience of the Triune God. &ldquo;The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&rdquo; is Jehovah, the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (<a href=Exo.htm#v3_15>Exo. 3:15</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v28_19>Matt. 28:19</a>). The experience of Abraham signifies the experience of God the Father in His calling man, justifying man, and equipping man to live by faith and to live in fellowship with Him (<a href=Gen.htm#v12_1>12:1</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v15_6>15:6</a>; chs. <a href=Gen.htm#v17>17</a>&mdash;<a href=Gen.htm#v18>18</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v19_29>19:29</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v21_1>21:1</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v21_13>13</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v22_1>22:1</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v22_18>18</a>). The experience of Isaac signifies the experience of God the Son in His redeeming man (<a href=Gen.htm#v22_1>22:1</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v22_14>14</a>) and His blessing man with the inheritance of all His riches, with a life of the enjoyment of His abundance, and with a life in peace (<a href=Gen.htm#v25_5>25:5</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v26_3>26:3</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v26_4>4</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v26_12>12</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v26_33>33</a>). The experience of Jacob (with Joseph) signifies the experience of God the Father in His loving man and choosing man (<a href=Mal.htm#v1_2>Mal. 1:2</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v9_10>Rom. 9:10</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v9_13>13</a>) and of God the Spirit in His working all things for the good of His lovers, in His transforming man, and in His making man mature in the divine life that man may be able to bless all the people, to rule over all the earth, and to satisfy all the people with God the Son as the life supply (<a href=Gen.htm#v27_41>27:41</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v28_1>28:1</a>&mdash;<a href=Gen.htm#v35_10>35:10</a>; chs. <a href=Gen.htm#v37>37</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v39>39</a>&mdash;<a href=Gen.htm#v49>49</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_28>Rom. 8:28</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>29</a>)."

Even before He was actually crucified, Christ daily lived a crucified life, denying Himself and His natural life and living the Father&rsquo;s life in resurrection (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_38>John 6:38</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v7_6>7:6</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v7_16>16</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v7_18>18</a>; cf. <a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20</a>)."

Once we believe into the Lord Jesus, we are &ldquo;shut in&rdquo; by God with no way to get out of Him (<a href=Joh.htm#v10_28>John 10:28</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v10_29>29</a> and <a href=JohN.htm#n10_28x1>note 28<sup>1</sup></a>)."

This implies the denying of our self and everything that is of our self (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_24>Matt. 16:24</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_25>25</a>) that we may be one with Him."
BD["M4)\x98"]="<b>spirit</b><br> &emsp; In His creation God made three crucial, equally important items&mdash;the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man. The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man was created by God with a spirit that he may contact God, receive God, worship God, live God, fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose for God, and be one with God. In His economy God planned to have Christ as the centrality and universality of His move on earth. For His chosen people, who would care for Him as the Creator and as the Redeemer, there was the need for Him to create a receiving organ so that they would have the capacity to receive all that God had planned for Christ to be. Hence, this book charges us to pay full attention to our human spirit, that we may receive the Christ revealed in this book and may understand all that is revealed therein concerning Him (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_17>Eph. 1:17</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_18>18a</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v3_5>3:5</a>).

BD["O)8\x98"]="<b>Joseph</b><br> &emsp; At this point the record of this genealogy does not say, &ldquo;Joseph begot Jesus,&rdquo; which is similar to what is said of all the foregoing persons; it says, &ldquo;Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus.&rdquo; Jesus was born of Mary, and not of Joseph, since it was prophesied that Christ would be the seed of the woman and would be born of a virgin (<a href=Gen.htm#v3_15>Gen. 3:15</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v7_14>Isa. 7:14</a>). Christ could not have been born of Joseph because Joseph was a man and a descendant of Jeconiah, none of whose descendants could inherit the throne of David (<a href=Jer.htm#v22_28>Jer. 22:28</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v22_30>30</a>). However, Mary was a virgin and a descendant of David (<a href=Luk.htm#v1_27>Luke 1:27</a>, <a href=Luk.htm#v1_31>31</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v1_32>32</a>); as such, she was the right person of whom Christ should be born. The marriage of Joseph and Mary brought Joseph into relationship with Christ and united into one the two lines of Christ&rsquo;s genealogy for the bringing in of Christ, as shown in the chart on p. 9 in the printed edition.<br> &emsp; This chart shows that the generation of Jesus Christ begins from God and continues until it reaches Jesus. It proceeds from God to Adam, from Adam to Abraham, from Abraham through Isaac and Jacob, and on to David. After David it divides into two lines, the first running from Nathan to Mary and the second from Solomon to Joseph. Eventually, these two lines are brought together by the marriage of Mary and Joseph, to bring in Jesus Christ. In this way Christ was apparently a descendant of Jeconiah, who seemed to be in the line of the royal family; actually, He was not a descendant of Jeconiah, Joseph&rsquo;s forefather, but a descendant of David, Mary&rsquo;s forefather, so that He could qualify to inherit the throne of David."
