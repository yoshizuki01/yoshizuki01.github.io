To be our salvation, the Triune God was processed to become the life-giving Spirit as the living water, the water of life (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v7_37>John 7:37</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v7_39>39</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_6>Rev. 21:6</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>22:1</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_17>17</a>). When the living water enters into us, it permeates our entire being, causing us to be nourished, transformed, conformed, and glorified (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_2>Rom. 12:2</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>8:29</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_30>30</a>).

Since he, the head of all the creatures, became fallen, something of Satan also entered into the creatures. In the restoration Christ&rsquo;s restoring power will deliver all the creatures from the poisonous element of Satan, causing a change not only in outward action but also in inward nature (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_19>Rom. 8:19</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_21>21</a>). As a result, the situation among them will be pleasant, peaceful, and loving. The reason for this change is that the knowledge of God, i.e., the knowing of God, will fill the earth (<a href=Isa.htm#v11_9>v. 9</a>)."

BD["e*7\x98"]="<b>world</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word is used for different things, as follows: In <a href=Mat.htm#v25_34>Matt. 25:34</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v17_5>John 17:5</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v17_24>Acts 17:24</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v1_4>Eph. 1:4</a>; and <a href=Rev.htm#v13_8>Rev. 13:8</a>, it denotes the material universe as a system created by God. In <a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>John 1:29</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_16>3:16</a>; and <a href=Rom.htm#v5_12>Rom. 5:12</a>, it denotes the fallen human race, corrupted and usurped by Satan to be the components of his evil world system. In <a href=1Pe.htm#v3_3>1&nbsp;Pet. 3:3</a> it denotes adorning, ornaments. Here, as in <a href=Joh.htm#v15_19>John 15:19</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v17_14>17:14</a>; and <a href=Jam.htm#v4_4>James 4:4</a>, it denotes an order, a set form, an orderly arrangement, hence, an ordered system (set up by Satan, the adversary of God), not the earth. God created man to live on the earth for the fulfillment of His purpose. But His enemy, Satan, in order to usurp the God-created man, formed an anti-God world system on this earth by systematizing men with religion, culture, education, industry, commerce, entertainment, etc., through men&rsquo;s fallen nature, in their lusts, pleasures, and pursuits, and even in their indulgence in necessities for their living, such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation (see <a href=JohN.htm#n12_31x2>note 31<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Joh.htm#v12>John 12</a>). The whole of such a satanic system lies in the evil one (<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_19>5:19</a>). Not loving such a world is the ground for overcoming the evil one. Loving it just a little gives the evil one the ground to defeat and occupy us."
BD["e*5\x9e"]="<b>write</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word denotes have written; in other MSS, write. Although have written is more authentic according to a more recent discovery of MSS, write, which is used by the KJV and J. N. Darby&rsquo;s New Translation, is more logical according to the context. The apostle in this verse addressed his writing to each of the three classes of his recipients, always in the present tense. In the succeeding verses, <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_14>14</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_27>27</a>, he addressed each of the three classes again, but always in the aorist tense (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_14>v. 14</a>, to the fathers and young men; <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_26>v. 26</a>, cf. <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_18>v. 18</a>, to the young children)."

He intended definitely to die and expected to be delivered from death, that is, to be resurrected from the dead (<a href=Luk.htm#v18_31>Luke 18:31</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v18_33>33</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v5_7>Heb. 5:7</a>)."
