BD["c+=\x97"]="<b>Which</b><br> &emsp; Referring to the water mentioned in the preceding verse, of which the water of baptism is the antitype. This indicates that Noah and his family&rsquo;s passing through the flood within the ark was a type of our passing through baptism. The water of the flood delivered them out of the old manner of life into a new environment; in like manner the water of baptism delivers us out of the inherited vain manner of life into a manner of life of resurrection in Christ. This is the main emphasis of this book. Christ redeemed us for this (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_18>1:18</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_19>19</a>). Christ&rsquo;s redemption was accomplished by Christ&rsquo;s death and was accepted and applied to us, in baptism, by the Spirit through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Now our daily walk should be in the Spirit of the resurrected Christ; it should be a walk in which we live Christ in resurrection through the life power of His Spirit (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_4>Rom. 6:4</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v6_5>5</a>). This is a new and excellent manner of life that glorifies God (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_12>2:12</a>)."
BD["a44\x97"]="<b>set</b><br> &emsp; Lit., set upright."
BD["d+4\x97"]="<b>Expecting</b><br> &emsp; While we live a transformed life in a holy and godly manner, we are expecting, awaiting, and hastening the coming of the day of God."
BD["e++\x97"]="<b>this</b><br> &emsp; The hope of being like the Lord, of bearing the likeness of the Triune God."
BD["c*\@\x97"]="<b>bore</b><br> &emsp; This points out that when the Lord offered up Himself as a sacrifice (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_27>Heb. 7:27</a>) on the cross, He bore up our sins in His body on the cross, the true altar for propitiation."
BD["d+2\x9d"]="<b>dissolved</b><br> &emsp; Compare dissolved and burned up with roll them up and changed in <a href=Heb.htm#v1_12>Heb. 1:12</a>, fled away and no place was found for them in <a href=Rev.htm#v20_11>Rev. 20:11</a>, and passed away in <a href=Rev.htm#v21_1>Rev. 21:1</a>. The burning with intense heat to dissolve the heavens and the earth is the procedure God will use to roll up the heavens and the earth and put them away that they may be changed from the old to the new (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_13>v. 13</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_1>Rev. 21:1</a>). This will be God&rsquo;s final and consummate dealing with His creation in His government. In God&rsquo;s final dealing all the material things will pass away, but His eternal word will abide forever (<a href=Mat.htm#v24_35>Matt. 24:35</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_25>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:25</a>). The word of His prophecy will remain and be fulfilled at His appointed time for the accomplishing of His eternal will, regardless of the change that will occur in the physical universe."
BD["e+*\x9a"]="<b>see</b><br> &emsp; By seeing Him we will reflect His likeness (<a href=2Co.htm#v3_18>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18</a>), which will cause us to be as He is."
BD["d*7\x97"]="<b>straight</b><br> &emsp; To take the straight way, such as the way of the truth (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_2>v. 2</a> and <a href=2PeN.htm#n2_2x2>note 2</a>) and the way of righteousness (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_21>v. 21</a> and <a href=2PeN.htm#n2_21x1>note 1</a>), is to live an upright life without crookedness and bias, without unrighteousness."
BD["e+)\x9d"]="<b>because</b><br> &emsp; The world is ignorant of our being regenerated by God; it does not know us, because it did not know God Himself. It was ignorant of God, so it is also ignorant of our divine birth."
BD["e*.\x97"]="<b>abides</b><br> &emsp; To be in Christ is the beginning of the Christian life. Our being put in Christ was God&rsquo;s doing once for all (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>). To abide in Christ is the continuation of the Christian life. This is our responsibility in our daily walk, a walk that is a copy of Christ&rsquo;s walk on earth. See <a href=1JoN.htm#n2_27x8>note 27<sup>8</sup></a>."
BD["e*-\x9a"]="<b>in</b><br> &emsp; I.e., in the Lord Jesus Christ (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_1>v. 1</a>). This is a strong expression, stressing that we are one with the Lord. Since we are one with the Lord, who is God, the loving essence of God becomes ours. It is supplied to us by the Lord&rsquo;s word of life for our walk of love that we may enjoy the fellowship of the divine life and abide in the divine light (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_10>v. 10</a>)."
BD["e)1\x97"]="<b>confess</b><br> &emsp; This denotes the confessing of our sins, our failures, after regeneration, not the confessing of our sins before regeneration."
BD["a51\x97"]="<b>various</b><br> &emsp; Various strange teachings are always used by Satan to cause dissension and even division in the church. Because of this, the apostle charged people not to teach different things (<a href=1Ti.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;Tim. 1:3</a>). The various strange teachings must have been taught at that time by the Judaizers. The writer warned the Hebrew believers not to let the teachings of the Judaizers carry them away from the church life under the new covenant."
BD["c,:\x97"]="<b>righteous</b><br> &emsp; Referring to the believers, who become righteous by being justified through their faith in Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_1>Rom. 5:1</a>) and by living a righteous life in Christ (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_9>Phil. 3:9</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v5_21>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:21</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v19_8>Rev. 19:8</a>)."
BD["c,9\x9a"]="<b>disobey</b><br> &emsp; This refers mainly to the disobedience of the unbelieving Jews, who rebelled against and opposed the change of dispensation, a turn from the Old Testament law of Moses to the New Testament gospel of Jesus Christ. This Epistle was written to Jewish believers (the chosen sojourners of the dispersion&mdash;<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_1>1:1</a>), who were suffering persecution. The persecution they were suffering did not come mainly from the Gentiles; it came mainly from the opposing Jews, the unbelieving Jews, those who disobeyed the gospel."
