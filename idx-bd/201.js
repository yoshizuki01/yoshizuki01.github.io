This reminds us that our sins issue from the sin that dwells in us. Christ&rsquo;s redemption accomplished for our sin resolves the problem of sin in its two aspects&mdash;sin in our inward nature and sins in our outward conduct.

Wheat signifies Christ incarnated to die for us (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_24>John 12:24</a>); barley, the first-ripe grain (<a href=2Sa.htm#v21_9>2&nbsp;Sam. 21:9</a>), signifies Christ as the firstfruits of resurrection (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_20>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:20</a>; <a href=Lev.htm#v23_10>Lev. 23:10</a>); oil signifies the Holy Spirit (<a href=Luk.htm#v4_18>Luke 4:18</a>); and the lamb signifies the redeeming Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>John 1:29</a>). In our service to God we need to offer such a Christ as a heave offering to God."

According to <a href=Gen.htm#v22_18>22:18</a>, this blessing would come to all the nations through Abraham&rsquo;s seed, who is Christ (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_1>Matt. 1:1</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v3_16>Gal. 3:16</a>).
