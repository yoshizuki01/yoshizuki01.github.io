BD["P88\x97"]="<b>believes</b><br> &emsp; To believe (see <a href=MrkN.htm#n1_15x3>note 15<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Mrk.htm#v1>ch. 1</a>) is to receive the Slave-Savior (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_12>John 1:12</a>) not only for forgiveness of sins (<a href=Act.htm#v10_43>Acts 10:43</a>) but also for regeneration (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_21>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:21</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_23>23</a>). Those who thus believe become the children of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_12>John 1:12</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_13>13</a>) and the members of Christ (<a href=Eph.htm#v5_30>Eph. 5:30</a>) in an organic union with the Triune God (<a href=Mat.htm#v28_19>Matt. 28:19</a>). To be baptized is to affirm this by being buried to terminate the old creation through the death of the Slave-Savior and by being raised up to be the new creation of God through the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s resurrection. Such a baptism is much more advanced than the baptism of repentance preached by John (<a href=Mrk.htm#v1_4>1:4</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v19_3>Acts 19:3</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v19_5>5</a>). To believe and to be so baptized are two parts of one complete step for receiving the full salvation of God. To be baptized without believing is merely an empty ritual; to believe without being baptized is to be saved only inwardly without an outward affirmation of the inward salvation. These two should go together. Moreover, water baptism should be accompanied by Spirit baptism, even as the children of Israel were baptized in the sea (water) and in the cloud (the Spirit)&mdash;<a href=1Co.htm#v10_2>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:2</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v12_13>12:13</a>."

In <a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a> the Lord said that He would build His church; yet here the apostle said that he was a builder, even a wise master builder. This indicates that the Lord builds the church not directly but through His ministers, even through every member of His Body, as revealed in <a href=Eph.htm#v4_16>Eph. 4:16</a>. Although in vv. <a href=1Co.htm#v3_5>5</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_7>7</a> the apostle admitted that he was nothing, here he frankly and faithfully made clear that by the grace of God he was a wise master builder who had laid the unique foundation, Christ, for others to build upon."
