The law could not give life (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_21>Gal. 3:21</a>), but the Son of God gives life to the dead (<a href=Joh.htm#v5_21>v. 21</a>). &ldquo;While we were yet weak&rdquo; (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_6>Rom. 5:6</a>), He came to enliven us."

Around 700 B.C., the Assyrians captured Samaria and brought people from Babylon and other heathen countries to the cities of Samaria (<a href=2Ki.htm#v17_6>2&nbsp;Kings 17:6</a>, <a href=2Ki.htm#v17_24>24</a>). From that time the Samaritans became a people of mixed heathen and Jewish blood.

But they were never recognized by the Jews as being part of the Jewish people."

They cared for their tradition, but they ignored God&rsquo;s commandment. In principle, the religious people today do the same thing. The Roman Catholic Church and most Protestant denominations make void the word of God because of their traditions."
