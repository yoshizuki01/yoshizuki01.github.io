The healthy teaching is always according to the truth (<a href=Tit.htm#v1_14>1:14</a>) of the faith (<a href=Tit.htm#v1_13>1:13</a>). It is the content of the apostles&rsquo; teaching, the content of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. It not only ministers the life supply to the believers and heals the spiritual diseases, but in so doing it also brings the church into a sound condition with a good order. Hence, it is very much stressed in these three books, 1 and 2&nbsp;Timothy and Titus, books dealing with the disorder and decline of the church."

It is only when we enjoy the Lord as grace that we can live a holy life for the church life, a life that is genuine and proper for the church, lived by our having the Lord as the life supply.<br> &emsp; In this book the holy life for the church life is developed. To be sanctified is to be holy. In the universe, only God is holy; only He is distinct and different from all other things. He is not common and therefore is undefiled. Holiness is God&rsquo;s nature; it is an intrinsic characteristic of God&rsquo;s attributes. Therefore, to be holy completely and entirely, to be holy not only in outward position but also in inward disposition, we must have the holy nature that is characteristic of God. To have this divine nature of God, we must possess God, having Him as our life and nature. Only God can sanctify us wholly and can preserve our entire being, our spirit and soul and body, complete, keeping it from being common or defiled. God desires to sanctify us, and He Himself will do it, as long as we are willing to pursue Him as holiness (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_14>Heb. 12:14a</a>) and cooperate with Him in this matter. In this way we can be holy as He is holy (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_15>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:15</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_16>16</a>). Without holiness we cannot see Him (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_14>Heb. 12:14b</a>).<br> &emsp; God not only has made us holy in position by the redeeming blood of Christ (<a href=Heb.htm#v13_12>Heb. 13:12</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_29>10:29</a>) but also is sanctifying us in disposition by His own holy nature. By thus sanctifying us, He transforms us in the essence of our spirit, soul, and body, making us wholly like Him in nature. In this way He preserves our spirit, soul, and body wholly complete. His making us holy in position is outside of us, whereas His sanctifying us in disposition is within us, beginning from our spirit, the deepest part, passing through our soul, the intermediate part, and reaching to our body, the outer part. This work, which penetrates us deeply, is accomplished through the regeneration of our spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_6>John 3:6</a>), the transformation of our soul (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_2>Rom. 12:2</a>), and the redemption of our body (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_23>Rom. 8:23</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v4_30>Eph. 4:30</a>) by God&rsquo;s life-giving Spirit. Such a holy and sanctified life is necessary for us to have a church life that is pleasing to God and that expresses Him."
