BD["U3=\x97"]="<b>supper</b><br> &emsp; In the apostle&rsquo;s time the believers had a custom of coming together for supper, the main meal of the day, with the rich bringing more and better food for the mutual enjoyment and the poor, less food. This was called a love feast (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_13>2&nbsp;Pet. 2:13</a>; <a href=Jud.htm#v12>Jude 12</a>), and it came from the background of the passover feast (<a href=Luk.htm#v22_13>Luke 22:13</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v22_20>20</a>). At the end of their love feast they ate the Lord&rsquo;s supper with the bread and the cup to remember the Lord (vv. <a href=1Co.htm#v11_23>23</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v11_25>25</a>). The Corinthians did not do it properly. They did not wait for one another (cf. <a href=1Co.htm#v11_33>v. 33</a>). Each took his own supper first. The rich became drunken and the poor were hungry (<a href=1Co.htm#v11_21>v. 21</a>). This caused divisions and parties among them (<a href=1Co.htm#v11_18>v. 18</a>) and spoiled the Lord&rsquo;s supper. Thus, their eating was not the eating of the Lord&rsquo;s supper (<a href=1Co.htm#v11_20>v. 20</a>)."

Christ stands in contrast to the law, the zeal for it, and the righteousness in it. The excellency of the knowledge of Christ and Christ Himself are in contrast to all things and to the law. On account of Christ and the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, Paul gave up the law, his zeal for it, the righteousness in it, and all other things. This indicates that Christ and the excellency of the knowledge of Christ are far superior to the law and all things."

Paul was a Jew and kept the vow, but he would not and did not impose it on the Gentiles. According to the principle of his teaching concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, Paul should have given up all the Jewish practices, which belonged to the Old Testament dispensation. However, he still had this vow, and it seems that God tolerated it, probably because it was a vow carried out in private outside Jerusalem and would not have had much effect on the believers."

The Corinthians misused their body by indulgence in fornication, not caring for God&rsquo;s temple (<a href=1Co.htm#v6_19>6:19</a>), and in the unrestrained eating of things sacrificed to idols, not caring for weak believers (<a href=1Co.htm#v8_9>8:9</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v8_13>13</a>)."

First, the chief priests, representing the authority of the Jewish religion, and the elders, representing the authority of the Jewish people, asked Him concerning His authority (<a href=Mat.htm#v21_23>21:23</a>). Their question was according to their religious concept. Second, the Pharisees, the fundamentalists, and the Herodians, who were zealous in politics, asked Him a question related to politics. Third, the Sadducees, the modernists, questioned Him concerning fundamental belief. Fourth, a self-approved lawyer asked Him a question concerning the law. After answering all their questions wisely, He asked them a question concerning the Christ. This is the question of questions. Their questions were related to religion, politics, belief, and the law. His question was concerning the Christ, who is the center of all things. They knew religion, politics, belief, and the law, but they paid no attention to Christ. Hence, He asked them, &ldquo;What do you think concerning the Christ?&rdquo; This question of questions must be answered by everyone."

This is proved by the words but the same Spirit in <a href=1Co.htm#v12_4>12:4</a>.

BD["T0O\x97"]="<b>love</b><br> &emsp; The love of God is the source of His eternal salvation.

Nothing can separate us from this love of God (vv. <a href=Rom.htm#v8_38>38</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_39>39</a>). In God&rsquo;s salvation this love to us has become the love of Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_35>v. 35</a>), which does many marvelous things for us through the grace of Christ until God&rsquo;s complete salvation is accomplished in us. These marvelous things provoke God&rsquo;s enemy to attack us with all kinds of sufferings and calamities (vv. <a href=Rom.htm#v8_35>35</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_36>36</a>). However, because of our response to the love of God in Christ, these attacks have become benefits to us (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_28>v. 28</a>). Hence, we more than conquer in all our afflictions and calamities (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_37>v. 37</a>).<br> &emsp; By the end of <a href=Rom.htm#v8>ch. 8</a> this book has covered the first half of God&rsquo;s salvation in Christ. This salvation has saved us to the extent that, on the one hand, we are in God&rsquo;s acceptance enjoying the source of this salvation, which is God&rsquo;s love in Christ, from which we cannot be separated by any person, matter, or thing; and, on the other hand, we are in God&rsquo;s life being conformed by the Lord Spirit to reach the ultimate goal of this salvation, that is, to enter into the incomparable divine glory and be glorified together with God (vv. <a href=Rom.htm#v8_18>18</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v8_30>30</a>)."
