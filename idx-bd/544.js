He was one who was fully perfected and equipped to minister the word of God, not only in caring for a local church but also in confronting the worsening decline of the church."

BD["_+-\x9a"]="<b>regeneration</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word for regeneration is different from that for regenerated in <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_23>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:23</a>. The only other place the word is used is <a href=Mat.htm#v19_28>Matt. 19:28</a>, where it is used for the restoration in the millennium (see <a href=MatN.htm#n19_28x1>note 1</a> there). Here it refers to a change from one state to another. Being born again is the commencing of this change. The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God&rsquo;s new creation, a process that makes us a new man. It is a kind of reconditioning, remaking, or remodeling, with life. Baptism (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_3>Rom. 6:3</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v6_5>5</a>), the putting off of the old man, the putting on of the new man (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_22>Eph. 4:22</a>, <a href=Eph.htm#v4_24>24</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v3_9>Col. 3:9</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v3_11>11</a>), and transformation by the renewing of the mind (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_2>Rom. 12:2</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v4_23>Eph. 4:23</a>) are all related to this wonderful process. The washing of regeneration purges away all the things of the old nature of our old man, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit imparts something new&mdash;the divine essence of the new man&mdash;into our being. In this is a passing from our old state into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation. Hence, both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are working in us continually throughout our life until the completion of the new creation."
BD["_*1\x97"]="<b>slaves</b><br> &emsp; Not servants but bondslaves bought in the market like oxen and horses. Certainly Paul did not agree with the system of slavery. However, as a teacher appointed by God and as one with spiritual sight, he did not touch the existing social system. To have done so would have given his readers the impression that he was a social reformer, not a teacher of God&rsquo;s economy, and would have obscured his teaching concerning the living out of Christ&rsquo;s divine life in our human living in the midst of any kind of social system."
