Hence, Abraham&rsquo;s believing was actually the springing up within him of the very element that God had transfused into him. God&rsquo;s reaction to Abraham&rsquo;s believing was to justify him, that is, to account him righteous. This accounting was not out of works but was based on his believing God."

Hence, both the teaching of the Pharisees and the teaching of the Sadducees were impure and evil and were likened to leaven, which was not to be seen among God&rsquo;s people (<a href=Exo.htm#v13_7>Exo. 13:7</a>)."

The Lord&rsquo;s making clay of the spittle signifies the mingling of humanity with the Lord&rsquo;s living word, which is the Spirit. The word anointed proves this, because the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit is the anointing Spirit (<a href=Luk.htm#v4_18>Luke 4:18</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v1_21>2&nbsp;Cor. 1:21</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v1_22>22</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_27>1&nbsp;John 2:27</a>). Here the Lord anointed the blind eyes with the clay made of His spittle, that they might have sight. This signifies that by the anointing of the mingling of the Lord&rsquo;s word (which is His Spirit) with our humanity, our eyes, which were blinded by Satan, can have sight."
