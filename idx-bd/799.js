In the second month as Moses was recording all the divine speakings, God must have charged him to write something concerning the passover, of which God had spoken to Moses in the first month. Moses&rsquo; recording of God&rsquo;s charge concerning the passover at this juncture indicates that after fulfilling the divine requirements and partaking of the divine provisions in the first eight chapters of this book, God&rsquo;s people should have a corporate feast to enjoy Christ before God and with God for their mutual satisfaction. This shows the importance of keeping the passover in relation to the move of God&rsquo;s redeemed people with God in His activity. Similarly, because the Lord&rsquo;s table has much to do with God&rsquo;s move on earth, the New Testament believers must keep the Lord&rsquo;s table (<a href=1Co.htm#v11_23>1&nbsp;Cor. 11:23</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v11_26>26</a>)."
