Gilgal was a place where God&rsquo;s people were circumcised to deal with their flesh (<a href=Jos.htm#v5_2>Josh. 5:2</a>-<a href=Jos.htm#v5_9>9</a>); Bethel is the place to give up the world and turn to God absolutely, taking God as everything (<a href=Gen.htm#v12_8>Gen. 12:8</a>); Jericho, the first city that Joshua and the people of Israel had to defeat when they entered into the good land, signifies the head of God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan (<a href=Jos.htm#v6_1>Josh. 6:1</a>-<a href=Jos.htm#v6_27>27</a>); and the river Jordan, where the New Testament baptism began, signifies death (<a href=Mat.htm#v3_5>Matt. 3:5</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v3_6>6</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n3_6x2>note 6<sup>2</sup></a>).

The fact that there were three pillars and three sockets on the two sides of the gate, and four pillars and four sockets for the gate, signifies that the appearance of the gate of the court of the tabernacle is that of man (signified by the number four) bearing the Triune God (signified by three) as a testimony (signified by two).

BD["(K)\x97"]="<b>Bethel</b><br> &emsp; At Bethel Jacob had made a vow to God, promising that if God would preserve him and care for him, the stone which he set up for a pillar would be the house of God (<a href=Gen.htm#v28_20>28:20</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v28_22>22</a>). Here, God reminded Jacob to fulfill his part of that vow (cf. <a href=Gen.htm#v31_13>31:13</a>). On his return from Paddan-aram, Jacob came to Shechem in the land of Canaan, and he settled there (<a href=Gen.htm#v33_18>33:18</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v33_20>20</a>). However, this was short of God&rsquo;s goal. God&rsquo;s purpose according to His heart&rsquo;s desire is to have Bethel, His house on earth. Thus, it was necessary for Jacob to go on from Shechem to Bethel. All the unfortunate events in <a href=Gen.htm#v34>ch. 34</a> were sovereignly used by God to make it impossible for Jacob to remain in Shechem and to prepare Jacob to receive God&rsquo;s charge to go up to Bethel. Jacob&rsquo;s passing through Shechem and going up to Bethel signifies our passing through the individual Christian life and going up to the corporate church life for the building up of God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place, which is the church today and the New Jerusalem in eternity.<br> &emsp; Bethel is a great seed in the Bible, a seed of the house of God. When Israel, the transformed Jacob, was multiplied into the house of Israel, in God&rsquo;s eyes the house of Israel was the house of God (see <a href=HebN.htm#n3_6x1>note 6<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v3>Heb. 3</a>). Eventually, the tabernacle and later the temple were built as symbols of the house of Israel as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth in the Old Testament time. In the beginning of the New Testament the Lord Jesus came through incarnation to be the reality of the tabernacle and the temple (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v2_18>2:18</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v2_21>21</a>). Then, in <a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a> the Lord prophesied that He would build the church as the habitation, the temple, of God (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>Eph. 2:22</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v3_16>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:16</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_17>17</a>) on Himself as the rock and with His believers as stones (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_11>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:11</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5</a>). This is Bethel, the house of God (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>). Ultimately, this Bethel will be enlarged to consummate in the New Jerusalem, the eternal tabernacle of God, in which God Himself and the Lamb will be the temple (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>Rev. 21:3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_22>22</a>). See <a href=GenN.htm#n28_12x1>note 12<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v28>ch. 28</a>."

Hence, the apostle said that the rock was Christ. Since it was a spiritual rock signifying Christ, it was able to follow the children of Israel.
