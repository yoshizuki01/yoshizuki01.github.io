Jehovah as Jesus set aside the three shepherds and destroyed them, and their souls detested Him. The Lord Jesus as the proper Shepherd was rejected, leaving the children of Israel as a flock without any shepherd (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v9_36>Matt. 9:36</a>).

BD["AT9\x97"]="<b>linen</b><br> &emsp; Linen garments signify a daily living and walk in the life-giving Spirit by the life of Christ. Such a living and walk is pure, clean, and fine. Woolen garments would cause the priests to sweat (<a href=Ezk.htm#v44_18>v. 18</a>), a sign of fallen man laboring under God&rsquo;s curse, without God&rsquo;s blessing, by his own energy and strength (<a href=Gen.htm#v3_19>Gen. 3:19</a>)."

Today He continues to gather people to Christ from throughout the earth."
BD["P+-\x97"]="<b>anger</b><br> &emsp; Toward the opposers the Savior&rsquo;s anger was exercised, and He was greatly grieved at their hardness; but toward the sick His compassion was exercised, and He restored the withered member. His anger and grief may be considered the expression of the genuineness of His humanity, whereas His compassion and healing were a merging of His human virtue with His divine power, which were manifested simultaneously to men. Thus, His deity in His humanity was again expressed before men. See <a href=MrkN.htm#n10_14x1>note 14<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mrk.htm#v10>ch. 10</a>."
BD["AQB\x97"]="<b>windows</b><br> &emsp; The fact that palm trees were carved on the walls next to the windows indicates that victory and everlasting power and strength always go together with spiritual air and divine light. This means that our victory and power are related to the life-giving Spirit (see <a href=1KiN.htm#n6_4x1>note 4<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=1Ki.htm#v6>1&nbsp;Kings 6</a>). If we enjoy the life-giving Spirit, we will also enjoy Christ&rsquo;s victory, power, and strength."

Such omniscience, which manifested His divine attribute, unveiled His deity, showing that He is the omniscient God.

This is for the kingdom of the heavens. Our spirit is the organ by which we receive Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_12>John 1:12</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_6>3:6</a>), whereas our heart is the ground where Christ as the seed of life grows (<a href=Mat.htm#v13_19>13:19</a>). For the kingdom of the heavens we need to be poor in spirit, empty in our spirit, that we may receive Christ. Also, we need to be pure, single, in our heart that Christ may grow in us without frustration."
