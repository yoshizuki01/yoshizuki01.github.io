BD["c*/\x97"]="<b>preciousness</b><br> &emsp; In Greek, a word kindred to precious in vv. <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_4>4</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_6>6</a>. The very Christ chosen by God as a stone, even a cornerstone that is precious to God, is the preciousness to His believers; but to the unbelievers He is a rejected, despised stone."
BD["c*-\x9d"]="<b>priesthood</b><br> &emsp; The holy priesthood is the spiritual house. In the New Testament three Greek words are used in relation to the priests: hierosune, referring to the priestly office, as in <a href=Heb.htm#v7_12>Heb. 7:12</a>; hierateia, referring to the priestly service, as in <a href=Heb.htm#v7_5>Heb. 7:5</a>; and hierateuma, referring to the assembly of priests, a body of priests, a priesthood, as in this verse and <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_9>v. 9</a>. The coordinated body of priests is the built-up spiritual house. Although Peter did not address his two Epistles to the church or use the term church in this verse in stressing the corporate life of the believers, he did use the terms spiritual house and holy priesthood to indicate the church life. It is not the spiritual life lived in an individualistic way, but the spiritual life lived in a corporate way, that can fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose and satisfy His desire. He wants a spiritual house for His dwelling, a priestly body, a priesthood, for His service. Peter&rsquo;s view concerning the believers&rsquo; corporate service in coordination is the same as Paul&rsquo;s in <a href=Rom.htm#v12>Rom. 12</a>. This service issues from the three vital steps in the spiritual life: being born anew (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_2>v. 2a</a>), growing in life by being nourished with Christ (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_2>v. 2b</a>), and being built up with the believers."

BD["a1,\x97"]="<b>Having</b><br> &emsp; Regarding the place where the incense altar stood, there is apparently a discrepancy between the Old Testament and the New Testament. <a href=Exo.htm#v30_6>Exodus 30:6</a> says that the incense altar was put before the veil, i.e., outside the veil. This indicates clearly that the incense altar was put in the Holy Place, which is outside the veil, not in the Holy of Holies, which is within the veil. But here it says that the Holy of Holies has the incense altar. Therefore, most Christian teachers and Bible readers have thought that some error or misconstruction must somehow have occurred. But this is not so! The apparent discrepancy has great spiritual significance, as shown by the following points:<br> &emsp; (1) The Old Testament record of the incense altar&rsquo;s location implies the closest relationship between the incense altar and the Ark of the Testimony, over which was the expiation cover, where God met with His people (<a href=Exo.htm#v30_6>Exo. 30:6</a>). The record even says that the incense altar was set before the Ark of the Testimony, with no mention being made of the separating veil that stood between them (<a href=Exo.htm#v40_5>Exo. 40:5</a>).<br> &emsp; (2) <a href=1Ki.htm#v6_22>First Kings 6:22</a> (ASV) says that the incense &ldquo;altar&hellip;belonged to the oracle.&rdquo; The Hebrew word for oracle includes the meaning the speaking place of God. The oracle denotes the Holy of Holies, in which was the Ark of the Testimony with the expiation cover, where God spoke to His people. Thus, the Old Testament indicated beforehand that the incense altar belonged to the Holy of Holies. (Though the incense altar was in the Holy Place, its function was for the Ark of the Testimony in the Holy of Holies. On the Day of Expiation, both the incense altar and the expiation cover of the Ark of the Testimony were sprinkled with the same blood for expiation&mdash;<a href=Exo.htm#v30_10>Exo. 30:10</a>; <a href=Lev.htm#v16_15>Lev. 16:15</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v16_16>16</a>.) Hence, in <a href=Exo.htm#v26_35>Exo. 26:35</a> only the showbread table and the lampstand are mentioned as being in the Holy Place; the incense altar is not mentioned.<br> &emsp; (3) The incense altar is related to prayer (<a href=Luk.htm#v1_10>Luke 1:10</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v1_11>11</a>), and in this book we are shown that to pray is to enter the Holy of Holies (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_19>10:19</a>) and to come to the throne of grace, which is signified by the expiation cover over the Ark of the Testimony in the Holy of Holies. Our prayer often begins with our mind, which is a part of our soul, signified by the Holy Place. But our prayer always ushers us into our spirit, signified by the Holy of Holies.<br> &emsp; (4) On account of all the above points, the writer of this book had to consider the incense altar as belonging to the Holy of Holies. <a href=Heb.htm#v9_4>Verse 4</a> does not say that a golden altar was in the Holy of Holies, as the lampstand and the table were in the Holy Place (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_2>v. 2</a>). It says that the Holy of Holies had a golden altar, because the altar belonged to the Holy of Holies. This concept fits the entire emphasis of the book of Hebrews, i.e., that we should press on from the soul (signified by the Holy Place) to the spirit (signified by the Holy of Holies).<br> &emsp; The incense altar belongs to the oracle&mdash;the speaking place of God, i.e., the Holy of Holies. The incense altar typifies Christ in His resurrection as the sweet and fragrant incense, in which God extends to us His well-pleased acceptance. We pray with such a Christ in order to contact God that God may be pleased to speak to us. We speak to God in our prayer with Christ as the sweet incense, and God speaks to us in the sweet savor of this incense. This is the dialogue in the sweet fellowship between us and God through Christ as the sweet incense."

Christ calls His lover to look from this, indicating that we must have our living in ascension, far above the evil powers (see <a href=EphN.htm#n6_12x4>note 12<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=Eph.htm#v6>Eph. 6</a>).

Among all these, our spirit is at the center; hence, our spirit is the hidden man of our heart. As wives, the sisters in the Lord should have as their adornment before God their inner being&mdash;the hidden man of their heart, which is adorned with a meek and quiet spirit. This spiritual adornment is very costly in the sight of God, and it is incorruptible, not like the material adornment of the plaiting of hair or the putting on of gold and garments, which is corruptible."
