BD["C3)\x98"]="<b>son</b><br> &emsp; Implying Christ in His union with Israel as the Son of God, who is loved by God and was called out of Egypt by God (<a href=Mat.htm#v2_13>Matt. 2:13</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v2_15>15</a>). This indicates that although Israel became exceedingly evil, Christ still became organically one with Israel through incarnation to be a real Israelite. Christ joined Himself to Israel in the matter of being a son of God.<br> &emsp; This verse implies Christ as the Son of God. It also implies that all God&rsquo;s chosen people become sons of God by virtue of their being organically united with Christ (cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v11_17>Rom. 11:17</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n11_17x1>notes</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v3_26>Gal. 3:26</a> and <a href=GalN.htm#n3_26x2>note 2</a>). This is possible because Christ is the Son of God in two aspects: the aspect of His being the only begotten Son of God and the aspect of His being the firstborn Son of God. In eternity Christ was God&rsquo;s only begotten Son (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_16>John 3:16</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v4_9>1&nbsp;John 4:9</a>), possessing only divinity without humanity. As such, He was unique. However, one day Christ was incarnated to be a man, taking on human nature and joining Himself with humanity (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>). After dying an all-inclusive, vicarious death on the cross, He entered into resurrection. In resurrection and through resurrection He was begotten of God in His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity (<a href=Act.htm#v13_33>Acts 13:33</a> and <a href=ActN.htm#n13_33x1>note</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v1_3>Rom. 1:3</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v1_4>4</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n1_3x1>notes</a>). Hence, in addition to His being the unique, only begotten Son of God from eternity, Christ, after His incarnation and through His resurrection, has become the Son of God in another sense, in the sense of being the firstborn Son of God (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_5>Heb. 1:5</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v1_6>6</a>). Furthermore, in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection all His believers were begotten of God, regenerated (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:3</a>), to be the many sons of God (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_10>Heb. 2:10</a>), Christ&rsquo;s many brothers (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>Rom. 8:29</a>), to be His members for the constituting of His organic Body. All this is implied in this verse."
