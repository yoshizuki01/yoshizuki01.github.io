Ezra concerns the return of God&rsquo;s people from their captivity (cf. Daniel, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi) to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple, and Nehemiah concerns the repair, the rebuilding, of the city. Esther presents to us a pattern of how the omnipresent and omnipotent God becomes the hiding God who secretly preserves and cares for His chosen people in their captivity.<br> &emsp; The book of Ezra provides a record of the two returns of the children of Israel from their captivity, which fulfilled God&rsquo;s promise, spoken through Jeremiah, that the captivity would last only seventy years (<a href=Jer.htm#v25_11>Jer. 25:11</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v25_12>12</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v29_10>29:10</a>; <a href=2Ch.htm#v36_21>2&nbsp;Chron. 36:21</a>-<a href=2Ch.htm#v36_22>22</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v9_2>Dan. 9:2</a>). The first return was under the kingly leadership of Zerubbabel (chs. <a href=Ezr.htm#v1>1</a>&mdash;<a href=Ezr.htm#v6>6</a>), a descendant of the royal family of David who was appointed to be the governor of Judah by Cyrus (<a href=Ezr.htm#v5_14>5:14</a>; cf. <a href=EzrN.htm#n1_8x1>note 8<sup>1</sup></a>). The second return was under the priestly leadership of Ezra (chs. <a href=Ezr.htm#v7>7</a>&mdash;<a href=Ezr.htm#v10>10</a>).<br> &emsp; The return of Israel to Jerusalem from their captivity was crucial in four points: (1) it recovered the purpose of God&rsquo;s calling Israel to make them His testimony according to His law (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n20_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v20>Exo. 20</a>); (2) it recovered the oneness of Israel on the unique ground of Jerusalem (<a href=Deu.htm#v12_5>Deut. 12:5</a>, <a href=Deu.htm#v12_11>11</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v12_14>14</a>); (3) it recovered Israel&rsquo;s enjoyment of the good land promised by God; and (4) it allowed God to fulfill His intention of having His house built and His kingdom established on the Satan-usurped earth in order to carry out His eternal economy through Israel&rsquo;s participation in and enjoyment of the good land. All the foregoing crucial points typify today&rsquo;s recovery of the church life, which is a recovery of the church out of captivity in the great Babylon (<a href=Rev.htm#v17_1>Rev. 17:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v17_6>6</a>) back to the unique ground of God&rsquo;s choice, the ground of oneness."

The Greek word means to observe the elements, to walk according to the elements, e.g., to walk in line, to march in military rank, to keep in step; and, derivatively, to walk in an orderly, regulated manner (cf. <a href=Gal.htm#v6_16>6:16</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v21_24>Acts 21:24</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v4_12>Rom. 4:12</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n4_12x1>note</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v3_16>Phil. 3:16</a> and <a href=PhiN.htm#n3_16x4>note 4</a>).<br> &emsp; Both the walk in <a href=Gal.htm#v5_16>v. 16</a> and the walk in this verse are by the Spirit and are regulated by the Spirit. The former refers to a general, daily walk; the latter, to a walk that takes God&rsquo;s unique goal as the direction and purpose of life, and a walk that follows the Spirit as the elementary rule, the basic principle. Such a walk is cultivated by living in the new creation (<a href=Gal.htm#v6_16>6:16</a> and <a href=GalN.htm#n6_16x2>note 2</a>), by pursuing Christ in order to gain Him (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_12>Phil. 3:12</a> and <a href=PhiN.htm#n3_12x1>notes</a>), and by practicing the church life (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_1>Rom. 12:1</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v12_5>5</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v4_1>Eph. 4:1</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v4_16>16</a>), thus fulfilling God&rsquo;s intention in Christ for the church."

Eventually, the requirement to provide these daily necessities became a factor in the people&rsquo;s rejecting of Solomon. Jeroboam took Solomon&rsquo;s extraordinary, luxurious life and his heavy levying on the people as the cause of his rebellion. Solomon lost the kingdom partly due to his indulgence in lust and idol worship and partly because the people were burdened by the need to provide for Solomon&rsquo;s vast family."

Here Solomon, the very one who had built the temple according to God&rsquo;s desire on the ground of the oneness of God&rsquo;s people, took the lead to build up the high places once again. These high places were related to fornication and idolatry. Solomon&rsquo;s setting up of the high places was especially connected with the indulgence of lust in his loving many foreign women.
