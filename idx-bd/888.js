Amen.<br> &emsp; The New Jerusalem, the last major item revealed in this book, is not only the conclusion of the entire Bible but also the ultimate consummation of all the important items revealed in the Bible. The Triune God, the Triune God&rsquo;s economy, Christ&rsquo;s redemption, God&rsquo;s salvation, the believers, the church, and the kingdom are all consummated in the New Jerusalem as the consummating item. Thus, to say that the New Jerusalem is a physical city is not logical; it does not correspond with this book&rsquo;s principle of using signs for the revelation of the mysterious things. According to the entire revelation of the complete Bible, the New Jerusalem, the conclusion of the complete Bible, is a divine mingling of the processed Triune God with the redeemed and transformed tripartite man, a mingling of divinity with humanity, issuing in a universal, corporate, mysterious person. This person is:<br> &emsp; (1) The wife of the Lamb (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_9>21:9</a>);<br> &emsp; (2) The ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s tabernacle and temple, as the eternal mutual habitation of both God and man (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>21:3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_22>22</a>);<br> &emsp; (3) The ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s work of the new creation in the old creation throughout the generations (<a href=Act.htm#v4_11>Acts 4:11</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v2_19>John 2:19</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v3_9>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:9</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_12>12</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_4>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:4</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>5</a>); and<br> &emsp; (4) The ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s eternal economy and God&rsquo;s divine accomplishments."
