In the continuation of the Passover the eating of unleavened bread for seven days (a full course of time) signifies that for our entire Christian life, from the time we receive Christ and are saved, we should continue our enjoyment by eliminating everything sinful.

This signifies that, although it is impossible for us to be completely without sin, we must eliminate any sin that is seen; i.e., we must forsake the sin of which we are conscious (cf. <a href=Heb.htm#v12_1>Heb. 12:1</a>). To deal with manifested sin is to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread (<a href=1Co.htm#v5_7>1&nbsp;Cor. 5:7</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v5_8>8</a>).
