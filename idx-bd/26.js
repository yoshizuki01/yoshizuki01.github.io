BD["c-*\x97"]="<b>Shepherd</b><br> &emsp; To shepherd the flock of God requires suffering for the Body of Christ as Christ suffered (<a href=Col.htm#v1_24>Col. 1:24</a>). This will be rewarded with the unfading crown of glory (<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_4>v. 4</a>)."

BD["c-)\x9a"]="<b>witness</b><br> &emsp; Peter and the early apostles were witnesses of Christ (<a href=Act.htm#v1_8>Acts 1:8</a>), not only as eyewitnesses testifying of what they had seen of Christ&rsquo;s suffering (<a href=Act.htm#v5_32>Acts 5:32</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v10_39>10:39</a>) but also as martyrs vindicating their testimony by suffering martyrdom for Him (<a href=Act.htm#v22_20>Acts 22:20</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v1_8>2&nbsp;Cor. 1:8</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v1_9>9</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v4_10>4:10</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v4_11>11</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v11_23>11:23</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v15_31>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:31</a>). This is to share in the sufferings of Christ (<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_13>4:13</a>), to participate in the fellowship of His sufferings (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_10>Phil. 3:10</a>)."

BD["c,,\x9a"]="<b>slandering</b><br> &emsp; I.e., speaking evilly of (you), speaking injuriously of (you) (<a href=Act.htm#v13_45>Acts 13:45</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_12>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:12</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v3_16>3:16</a>). The believers, whose behavior was thought strange, were slandered unjustly and accused of all manner of crimes."
BD["c+/\x9a"]="<b>assigning</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word for assigning means to apportion, to portion out; hence, to assign to. The word for honor means preciousness, valuable worth. The husbands should appreciate the preciousness, the valuable worth, of the wives and apportion it, assign it, as honor to them, duly and reasonably, as also to fellow heirs of the grace of life."

BD["c)5\x9a"]="<b>grace</b><br> &emsp; I.e., the salvation of the soul (vv. <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_5>5</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_9>9</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_10>10</a>), which will be the consummation of God&rsquo;s full salvation. Grace was brought to us by the Lord&rsquo;s first coming (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_17>John 1:17</a>). It will be consummated by His second coming. On such grace we should set our hope."
BD["b-3\x97"]="<b>endured</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word&mdash;in verb form here and in noun form in <a href=Rom.htm#v5_3>Rom. 5:3</a> and <a href=2Co.htm#v1_6>2&nbsp;Cor. 1:6</a>&mdash;connotes patience toward things, such as the patience that Job had toward the things that afflicted him."

BD["a10\x97"]="<b>way</b><br> &emsp; The first tabernacle, the Holy Place, signifies the old covenant, and the second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, signifies the new covenant. The veil that closed off the Holy of Holies was rent (<a href=Mat.htm#v27_51>Matt. 27:51</a>) by the death of Christ, which crucified the flesh (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_20>10:20</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v5_24>Gal. 5:24</a>), and now the way of the Holy of Holies has been manifested. Hence, we do not need to remain in the Holy Place, i.e., the old covenant, the soul; we must enter into the Holy of Holies, i.e., the new covenant, the spirit. That is the goal of this book."
BD["b,6\x97"]="<b>vapor</b><br> &emsp; The tone of James&rsquo;s word here also is like the tone of the Old Testament (cf. <a href=Psa.htm#v90_3>Psa. 90:3</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v90_10>10</a>). In any case, his word arouses a fear of one&rsquo;s self-will and instills a confidence in God, as expressed in <a href=Jam.htm#v4_15>v. 15</a>. This kind of word always comes out of the mouth of a God-fearing person."
BD["a03\x97"]="<b>Know</b><br> &emsp; In this verse two Greek words are used for know: the first is ginosko, which signifies the outward, objective knowledge; the second is oida, which refers to the inward, subjective consciousness. In <a href=Joh.htm#v8_55>John 8:55</a> the Lord Jesus told the Pharisees that they did not know (ginosko) God the Father (even in the outward, objective knowledge), and that He did know (oida) the Father (in the inward, subjective consciousness). Both words are used in <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_29>1&nbsp;John 2:29</a>."
BD["b+9\x97"]="<b>wisdom</b><br> &emsp; This wisdom includes meekness (<a href=Jam.htm#v3_13>v. 13</a>) and the human virtues mentioned in the rest of this verse. All these are characteristics of practical Christian perfection according to James&rsquo;s view, which was under the influence of Old Testament precepts concerning man&rsquo;s behavior, morality, and ethics (<a href=Prv.htm#v4_5>Prov. 4:5</a>-<a href=Prv.htm#v4_8>8</a>). Such wisdom does not attain to the height of the wisdom concerning the hidden mystery of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy regarding Christ and the church (<a href=1Co.htm#v2_6>1&nbsp;Cor. 2:6</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v2_8>8</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v3_9>Eph. 3:9</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v3_11>11</a>).
