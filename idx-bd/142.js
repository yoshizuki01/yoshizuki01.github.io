BD[":1+\x97"]="<b>enemies</b><br> &emsp; This psalm expresses David&rsquo;s concept concerning God&rsquo;s judgment on his enemies among the nations, and in <a href=Psa.htm#v10>Psa. 10</a>&mdash;<a href=Psa.htm#v14>14</a> David speaks of man&rsquo;s condition before God. David&rsquo;s concept in these six psalms is according to the law given by God (see <a href=PsaN.htm#n1_2x1>note 2<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Psa.htm#v1>Psa. 1</a>) and is based on the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>Gen. 2:9</a>). Nothing in these psalms is related to God&rsquo;s economy, to God&rsquo;s interest, to God&rsquo;s kingdom, or to God&rsquo;s plan. Everything is concerning David&rsquo;s personal benefit, personal interest, personal safety, and personal peace. The New Testament believers, who live by Christ as the tree of life for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy, should not take David here as a model."

BD[":0.\x97"]="<b>rule</b><br> &emsp; Verses <a href=Psa.htm#v8_6>6</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v8_8>8</a> specifically refer to the one-thousand-year kingdom, the millennium, in which the man Christ will rule over all the created things, and to the restoration in the kingdom. This word was fulfilled first in Adam (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_26>Gen. 1:26</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v1_28>28</a>), but it was broken by man&rsquo;s fall. It will be fulfilled in full in Christ with His Body, the overcomers, in the millennium, the age of restoration (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>Rev. 20:4</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v19_28>Matt. 19:28</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v11_6>Isa. 11:6</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v11_9>9</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v65_25>65:25</a>)."

BD["a*2\x8c"]="For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
BD["a++\x98"]="<b>built</b><br> &emsp; Moses had the human nature, which is fit for God&rsquo;s building, but he did not have the divine nature, which is suitable for being the builder. In contrast, Christ in His humanity is the good material for God&rsquo;s building (the foundation stone&mdash;<a href=Isa.htm#v28_16>Isa. 28:16</a>; the cornerstone&mdash;<a href=Mat.htm#v21_42>Matt. 21:42</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v4_11>Acts 4:11</a>; the topstone&mdash;<a href=Zec.htm#v4_7>Zech. 4:7</a>; and the living stone that produces us as living stones&mdash;<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_4>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:4</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>5</a>). Moreover, in His divinity He is the Builder."
