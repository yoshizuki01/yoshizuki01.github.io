God desires to have a house on earth, and His intention is to transform His called ones into stones, material for His building. In the account of Jacob&rsquo;s dream, the stone (vv. <a href=Gen.htm#v28_11>11</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v28_18>18</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v28_22>22</a>), the pillar (<a href=Gen.htm#v28_18>v. 18</a>), the house of God (vv. <a href=Gen.htm#v28_17>17</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v28_19>19</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v28_22>22</a>), and the oil (<a href=Gen.htm#v28_18>v. 18</a>) are outstanding items. The stone symbolizes Christ as the foundation stone, the top stone, and the cornerstone for God&rsquo;s building (<a href=Isa.htm#v28_16>Isa. 28:16</a>; <a href=Zec.htm#v4_7>Zech. 4:7</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v4_10>Acts 4:10</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v4_12>12</a>). It also symbolizes the transformed man, who has been constituted with Christ as the transforming element to be the material for the building of God&rsquo;s house (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_12>2:12</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_42>John 1:42</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v3_12>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:12</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_11>Rev. 21:11</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_18>18</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_20>20</a>), which is the church today (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>) and which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal dwelling place of God and His redeemed elect (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>Rev. 21:3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_22>22</a>). In <a href=Gen.htm#v28_11>v. 11</a> a stone was used by Jacob for a pillow, signifying that the very divine element of Christ constituted into our being through our subjective experience of Him becomes a pillow for our rest (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v11_28>Matt. 11:28</a>). After awaking from his dream, Jacob set up the pillow-stone as a pillar, signifying that the Christ who has been wrought into us and on whom we rest becomes the material and the support for God&rsquo;s building, God&rsquo;s house (cf. <a href=1Ki.htm#v7_21>1&nbsp;Kings 7:21</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v2_9>Gal. 2:9</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v3_12>Rev. 3:12</a>). Eventually, Jacob poured oil, a symbol of the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God reaching man (<a href=Exo.htm#v30_23>Exo. 30:23</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v30_30>30</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v4_18>Luke 4:18</a>), on the pillar, symbolizing that the transformed man is one with the Triune God and expresses Him. That stone became Bethel, the house of God (vv. <a href=Gen.htm#v28_19>19</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v28_22>22</a>). God&rsquo;s house is the mutual dwelling place of God and His redeemed (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_2>John 14:2</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v14_23>23</a>)&mdash;man as God&rsquo;s dwelling place (<a href=Isa.htm#v66_1>Isa. 66:1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v66_2>2</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v3_16>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:16</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>Eph. 2:22</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v3_6>Heb. 3:6</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>Rev. 21:3</a>) and God as man&rsquo;s dwelling place (<a href=Psa.htm#v90_1>Psa. 90:1</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v15_5>John 15:5</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_22>Rev. 21:22</a>).
