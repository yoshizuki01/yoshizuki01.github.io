BD["h)4\x97"]="<b>hidden</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means a rock. It &ldquo;may allude here to a sunken rock with the sea over it&rdquo; (Darby); hence, hidden reefs. The Greek word for spots in <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_13>2&nbsp;Pet. 2:13</a> is very similar to the word here for hidden reefs; hence, some translations render this word spots. Actually, these two words refer to two different things. The spots are defects on the surface of precious stones; the hidden reefs are at the bottom of the water. The early heretics were not only spots on the surface but also hidden reefs at the bottom, both of which were a damage to the believers in Christ."
