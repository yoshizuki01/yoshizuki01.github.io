BD[":\x9e\@\x97"]="<b>day</b><br> &emsp; This day is the day of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. On the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus was made the cornerstone by God. Christ was chosen by God in eternity past to be the cornerstone for God&rsquo;s spiritual building (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_20>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:20</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_4>2:4</a>). Then, the Jewish leaders as the builders rejected Him to the uttermost, to such an extent that they put Him on the cross (<a href=Mat.htm#v21_38>Matt. 21:38</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v21_42>42a</a>). God chose Christ as the cornerstone a second time in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (<a href=Act.htm#v4_10>Acts 4:10</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v4_11>11</a>), thereby confirming His initial choosing of Christ in eternity past. After God resurrected Christ, He uplifted Him to the heavens (<a href=Luk.htm#v24_51>Luke 24:51</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v1_9>Acts 1:9</a>). Christ&rsquo;s ascension to Zion in the heavens (<a href=Rev.htm#v14_1>Rev. 14:1</a>) was a further confirmation that God had chosen Him to be the cornerstone (<a href=Isa.htm#v28_16>Isa. 28:16</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_6>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:6</a>). Both Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and His ascension prove and confirm that He is the One whom God has chosen to be the head of the corner for God&rsquo;s building.<br> &emsp; As the all-inclusive stone Christ is the centrality of God&rsquo;s move for the building up of His eternal habitation (<a href=Mat.htm#v21_42>Matt. 21:42</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v21_44>44</a>; <a href=Zec.htm#v3_9>Zech. 3:9</a>, cf. <a href=Rev.htm#v5_5>Rev. 5:5</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v5_6>6</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v4_10>Acts 4:10</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v4_12>12</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v28_16>Isa. 28:16</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_19>Eph. 2:19</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>22</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_4>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:4</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_8>8</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v2_34>Dan. 2:34</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v2_35>35</a>; <a href=Zec.htm#v4_7>Zech. 4:7</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_11>Rev. 21:11</a>, cf. <a href=Psa.htm#v4_3>4:3</a>). Everything Christ is, everything He has done, and everything He is doing is due to the fact that He is the cornerstone. It is by His being the cornerstone that He could die for us, that we could be crucified with Him, made alive with Him, resurrected with Him, and seated with Him in the heavenlies, and that He could save us, transform us into precious stones, and build us together to be God&rsquo;s habitation, God&rsquo;s unique temple in the universe."
