As the son of Cushi, Zephaniah was a royal descendant who was related to two good kings of Judah, Hezekiah and Josiah.<br> &emsp; The central thought of this book is that Jehovah is the judging and saving God both to Israel and to the nations, issuing in His reigning among Israel (<a href=Zep.htm#v3_15>3:15b</a>) and in Israel&rsquo;s singing and rejoicing in their restoration (<a href=Zep.htm#v3_14>3:14</a>). Jehovah judges Israel as well as the nations, and He saves the nations as well as Israel. His judgment and His salvation are universal. Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on Israel and on the nations and His salvation to the Gentiles and to Israel have a particular order: His judgment is first on Israel and then on the nations (cf. <a href=1Pe.htm#v4_17>1&nbsp;Pet. 4:17a</a>), but His salvation is first to the Gentiles and then to Israel (<a href=Rom.htm#v11_11>Rom. 11:11</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v11_25>25</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v11_26>26</a>)."

BD[">P)\x97"]="<b>Comfort</b><br> &emsp; Isaiah is a book of two main sections. The first section (chs. <a href=Isa.htm#v1>1</a>&mdash;<a href=Isa.htm#v39>39</a>) concerns God&rsquo;s governmental dealing with His beloved Israel and His punishing judgment on the nations so that Israel may be brought back to God and the all-inclusive Christ may be ushered in with the expected restoration of all things (<a href=Isa.htm#v11_6>11:6</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v11_9>9</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v35_5>35:5</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v35_6>6</a>; cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v19_28>Matt. 19:28</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v10_1>10:1</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_19>Rom. 8:19</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_23>23</a>). The last section of Isaiah (chs. <a href=Isa.htm#v40>40</a>&mdash;<a href=Isa.htm#v66>66</a>) is the kind word of Jehovah spoken to the heart of Israel, His beloved people. This word unveils the prophet&rsquo;s vision concerning the redeeming and saving Christ as the Servant of Jehovah and reveals the all-inclusive salvation brought in by Christ to Israel and the nations, with the full restoration of all things, consummating in the new heaven and new earth.<br> &emsp; The first thirty-nine chapters of Isaiah, corresponding to the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, focus mainly on the old creation, whereas the last twenty-seven chapters, corresponding to the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, center on the new creation (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:17</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v6_15>Gal. 6:15</a>). Both this chapter and the New Testament begin with the coming of John the Baptist, who ushered in the expected Christ for the initiation of the new creation (<a href=Isa.htm#v40_3>v. 3</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v1_1>Mark 1:1</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v1_11>11</a>). The coming of the new creation does not immediately end the old creation; rather, the old creation remains for a time, until it is terminated at the end of the millennium (cf. <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_7>2&nbsp;Pet. 3:7</a>, <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_10>10</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_12>12</a>). The end of the thousand-year kingdom will be the termination of the old creation as well as the completion, the consummation, of the new creation, which is signified by the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_13>2&nbsp;Pet. 3:13</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_1>Rev. 21:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>2</a>)."

BD[":\\)\x97"]="<b>Why</b><br> &emsp; Psalms <a href=Psa.htm#v52>52</a>&mdash;<a href=Psa.htm#v67>67</a> may be considered the pious expressions of the psalmists uttered out of their complex sentiments while enjoying God in His house. On the one hand, the psalmists enjoyed God and His salvation, and on the other hand, they condemned their enemies and asked God to judge and destroy them. In these psalms the sentiments of the psalmists were strong, mixed, and complex.<br> &emsp; The psalms in this section concern humanity in the ethical realm. They speak of being just and upright and holding on to one&rsquo;s integrity. However, these things are not the spirituality revealed in the New Testament. The divine revelation in the Bible is progressive. To properly appreciate the Psalms requires the revelation of God&rsquo;s economy in the New Testament. God&rsquo;s eternal economy is to impart Himself into man and dispense His riches into man&rsquo;s inner being (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_8>Eph. 3:8</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v3_9>9</a>, <a href=Eph.htm#v3_14>14</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v3_19>19</a>) that He may be man&rsquo;s life and life supply. By His life and the bountiful supply of His life-giving Spirit (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_19>Phil. 1:19b</a>), man can live Him and magnify Him (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_20>Phil. 1:20</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>21a</a>) for His manifestation (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_16>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:16a</a>). In this way, all His chosen people can corporately be His expression as His fullness, His organism, the church (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_22>Eph. 1:22</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>23</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v3_19>3:19</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v3_21>21</a>). In comparison with the spiritual standard revealed in the New Testament, the spiritual level in these psalms is much inferior. Cf. <a href=JobN.htm#n6_1x1P2>note 1<sup>1</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=Job.htm#v6>Job 6</a>."
