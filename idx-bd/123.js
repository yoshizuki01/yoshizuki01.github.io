BD["O)9\x97"]="<b>all</b><br> &emsp; This genealogy is divided into three ages: (1) from Abraham until David, fourteen generations, the age before the establishing of the kingdom; (2) from David until the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations, the age of the kingdom; (3) from the deportation to Babylon until the Christ, again fourteen generations, the age after the fall of the kingdom. According to history, there were actually forty-five generations. By deducting from these generations the three cursed generations and the one improper generation, and then adding one by making David two generations (one, the age before the establishing of the kingdom, and the other, the age of the kingdom), the generations total forty-two, being divided into three ages of fourteen generations each. The number fourteen is composed of ten plus four. Four signifies creatures (<a href=Rev.htm#v4_6>Rev. 4:6</a>); ten signifies fullness (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_1>25:1</a>). Hence, fourteen signifies the creatures in full. Fourteen generations being multiplied by three indicates that the Triune God mingles Himself with the creatures in full.<br> &emsp; This genealogy is of three sections: the section of the fathers, the section of the kings, and the section of the civilians, which includes the captured ones and the recovered ones. God the Father corresponds with the section of the fathers, God the Son with the section of the kings, and God the Spirit with the section of the civilians. This too indicates the mingling of the Triune God with His human creatures.<br> &emsp; Three times fourteen is forty-two. Forty is the number for trials, temptations, and sufferings (<a href=Heb.htm#v3_9>Heb. 3:9</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v4_2>Matt. 4:2</a>; <a href=1Ki.htm#v19_8>1&nbsp;Kings 19:8</a>). Forty-two signifies rest and satisfaction after trial. The children of Israel traveled through forty-two stations before they entered the good land of rest. The millennial kingdom as a rest will come after the forty-two months of the great tribulation (<a href=Rev.htm#v13_5>Rev. 13:5</a>). After all the generations of trials, temptations, and sufferings, Christ came as the forty-second generation to be our rest and satisfaction."

BD["O+3\x97"]="<b>fire</b><br> &emsp; According to the context, the fire here is not the fire in <a href=Act.htm#v2_3>Acts 2:3</a>, which is related to the Holy Spirit, but is the same fire as in vv. <a href=Mat.htm#v3_10>10</a> and <a href=Mat.htm#v3_12>12</a>, the fire in the lake of fire (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_15>Rev. 20:15</a>), where the unbelievers will suffer eternal perdition. John&rsquo;s word spoken here to the Pharisees and Sadducees means that if the Pharisees and Sadducees would genuinely repent and believe in the Lord, the Lord would baptize them in the Holy Spirit that they might have eternal life; otherwise, the Lord will baptize them in fire, putting them into the lake of fire for eternal punishment. John&rsquo;s baptism was only for repentance, to usher people to faith in the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s baptism is either for eternal life in the Holy Spirit or for eternal perdition in fire. The Lord&rsquo;s baptism in the Holy Spirit initiated the kingdom of the heavens, bringing His believers into the kingdom of the heavens, whereas His baptism in fire will terminate the kingdom of the heavens, putting the unbelievers into the lake of fire. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s baptism in the Holy Spirit, which is based on His redemption, is the beginning of the kingdom of the heavens, whereas His baptism in fire, which is based on His judgment, is the ending of that kingdom. Thus, in this verse there are three kinds of baptisms: the baptism in water, the baptism in the Spirit, and the baptism in fire. The baptism in water by John introduced people to the kingdom of the heavens. The baptism in the Spirit by the Lord Jesus commenced and established the kingdom of the heavens on the day of Pentecost and will carry it on to its consummation at the end of this age. The baptism in fire by the Lord according to the judgment at the great white throne (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_11>Rev. 20:11</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_15>15</a>) will conclude the kingdom of the heavens."

The war of Armageddon will be the greatest war among mankind.

Although this war will be motivated by Antichrist with the intention of destroying Israel, it will be waged by Satan through his human followers as his earthly army, against God with His saints as His heavenly army (<a href=Zec.htm#v14_2>14:2</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v14_5>5</a>; <a href=Joe.htm#v3_11>Joel 3:11</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v16_13>Rev. 16:13</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v16_14>14</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v17_14>17:14</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v19_14>19:14</a>). Antichrist, the embodiment of Satan, will be the commander of Satan&rsquo;s army, and Christ, the embodiment of God, will be the Commander of God&rsquo;s army. In this divine war Christ will destroy Antichrist by the breath of His mouth and bring him to nothing by the manifestation of His coming (<a href=2Th.htm#v2_8>2&nbsp;Thes. 2:8</a>). This war will be the great winepress of the fury of God trodden by Christ at His coming back to judge the world (<a href=Isa.htm#v63_1>Isa. 63:1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v63_6>6</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v14_17>Rev. 14:17</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v14_20>20</a>)."
