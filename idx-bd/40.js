After returning from their captivity, the captives had a sweet remembrance of the sorrowful experience of captivity. In spiritual experience, when we fall and are brought back by the Lord, in our reminiscence we taste the sweetness of the Lord&rsquo;s mercy in restoring us."
BD["e*;\x97"]="<b>not</b><br> &emsp; These antichrists were not born of God and were not in the fellowship of the apostles and the believers (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_3>1:3</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v2_42>Acts 2:42</a>); hence, they were not of the church, that is, of the Body of Christ."
BD["f)5\x97"]="<b>children</b><br> &emsp; This indicates what an intimate fellowship with the church members and what an endearing care for them the aged elder had.<br> &emsp; In carrying out his mending ministry with the divine life of the Triune God, the aged apostle John&rsquo;s endearing care for the believers was that the believers would walk in God&rsquo;s truth. God&rsquo;s truth is that the Triune God was incarnated to be the God-man, Christ, who had both divinity and humanity, who through crucifixion accomplished eternal redemption and through resurrection became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, to be received by those who repent and believe in Him, as their life and as their everything. The aged apostle&rsquo;s desire was that the believers would love one another in this truth by the divine love of the Triune God to express Him. This truth, this reality, became the genuineness in the apostle&rsquo;s walk, the divine virtue expressed in his redeemed humanity. He loved the believers whom he cared for, in the genuineness of the divine virtue. His love toward the believers was his living, in which the reality, the truth, of the Triune God was joined to the love of the Triune God. Based on this love, he also earnestly hoped that the believers whom he cared for would be the same as he, that they would love one another and have nothing to do with the heretics, those who went beyond the truth concerning the Trinity. The aged apostle&rsquo;s desire was that the believers whom he cared for would remain continually in the divine truth to enjoy the Father and the Son by the Spirit unto eternity."

BD["e,5\x97"]="<b>this</b><br> &emsp; In that God has given to us of His Spirit, we know that we abide in Him and He in us. The Spirit, whom God has given to dwell in us (<a href=Jam.htm#v4_5>James 4:5</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_9>Rom. 8:9</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v8_11>11</a>), is the witness in our spirit (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_16>Rom. 8:16</a>), witnessing that we dwell in God and God in us. The abiding Spirit, that is, the indwelling Spirit, is the element and sphere of the mutual abiding, the mutual indwelling, of us and God. By Him we are assured that we and God are one, that we abide in each other, indwelling each other mutually. This is evidenced by our living, a living in which we love one another habitually with His love (<a href=1Jo.htm#v4_12>v. 12</a>)."
BD["e,4\x9a"]="<b>perfected</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means to complete, to accomplish, to finish. In God Himself the love of God itself is perfect and complete. However, in us it needs to be perfected and completed in its manifestation. It was manifested to us in God&rsquo;s sending of His Son to be both a propitiatory sacrifice and life to us (vv. <a href=1Jo.htm#v4_9>9</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v4_10>10</a>). Yet if we do not love one another with this love as it was manifested to us, that is, if we do not express it by loving one another with the love with which God loved us, it is not manifested perfectly and completely. This love is perfected and completed in its manifestation when we express it in our living by habitually loving one another with it. Our living in which we love one another in the love of God is the perfection and completion of this love in its manifestation in us. Thus, in our living in God&rsquo;s love, others can behold God manifested in His essence, which is love."
