BD["N,*\x97"]="<b>Sun</b><br> &emsp; The healing Christ, who Himself is the healing of God&rsquo;s people and of the nations. Christ is the Sun that heals us as it shines upon us. Christ&rsquo;s being our healing is based on His being the Sun of righteousness. The word Sun indicates life (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v1_4>John 1:4</a>), and the word righteousness indicates justice. The whole earth is filled with death and injustice, but with the healing Christ there is life and justice. Today we, the believers in Christ, enjoy Christ&rsquo;s shining as the Sun of righteousness for our growth in life in the dispelling of darkness, and also for our healing in life in the effacing of unrighteousness. Our hope, our expectation, is that Christ is coming as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings to heal the nations from darkness and unrighteousness. We are waiting for Him as the Desire of the nations (<a href=Mal.htm#v3_1>3:1b</a>; <a href=Hag.htm#v2_7>Hag. 2:7b</a>) and as the Sun of righteousness.<br> &emsp; In relation to Israel, Christ came the first time to heal the degraded priesthood (<a href=Mal.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>-<a href=Mal.htm#v3_4>4</a>), but in His second coming, He will heal the remnant of the people of Israel. Then He will be everything to the nations and to His people. This healing Christ will come suddenly. Thus, we need to be alert, ready to receive Him."

BD["AS*\x97"]="<b>glory</b><br> &emsp; The glory of the Lord returned to the temple because the building of the temple was completed. This indicates that in order for the God of glory to dwell in the church, the church must be built up to become the dwelling place of God (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_14>Eph. 3:14</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v3_21>21</a>)."

BD["N+-\x97"]="<b>stranger</b><br> &emsp; Jehovah&rsquo;s concern for the stranger indicates that as Christ He is very human and that He is not happy when His people ill-treat a stranger instead of giving him hospitality."
BD["O)*\x97"]="<b>Isaac</b><br> &emsp; Abraham begot eight sons (<a href=Gen.htm#v16_15>Gen. 16:15</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v21_2>21:2</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v21_3>3</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v25_2>25:2</a>). Among those eight, only Isaac is counted as the promised seed (<a href=Rom.htm#v9_7>Rom. 9:7</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v9_8>8</a>). Hence, Christ is his descendant to fulfill God&rsquo;s promise given to Abraham and to him (<a href=Gen.htm#v22_18>Gen. 22:18</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v26_4>26:4</a>)."
BD["AP3\x97"]="<b>ten</b><br> &emsp; The number ten here implies the Ten Commandments. This indicates that whatever the Ten Commandments require, the entry of the gate fulfills. The Lord Jesus as the &ldquo;square,&rdquo; upright, and perfect man (see <a href=EzkN.htm#n40_5x1>note 5<sup>1</sup></a>) fulfilled all the requirements of the Ten Commandments, and He has become the gate for us to enter into God&rsquo;s building. For additional details concerning the gate, see Life-study of Ezekiel, Message Nineteen."
BD["O))\x9a"]="<b>son</b><br> &emsp; Isaac is a type of Christ as the son of Abraham, the One who inherits the promise and blessing God gave to Abraham (<a href=Gen.htm#v22_17>Gen. 22:17</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v22_18>18</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v3_16>Gal. 3:16</a>, <a href=Gal.htm#v3_14>14</a>). Isaac also, as a type of Christ, did mainly two things: he obeyed his father even unto death and was resurrected from death (<a href=Gen.htm#v22_9>Gen. 22:9</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v22_10>10</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v11_19>Heb. 11:19</a>), and he took Rebekah, a Gentile woman, as his wife (<a href=Gen.htm#v24_61>Gen. 24:61</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v24_67>67</a>). Christ, in fulfilling this type, was put to death and offered to God and was resurrected from death, and He is taking the church as His bride out of the Gentiles."
BD["M-0\x97"]="<b>lead</b><br> &emsp; A lead cover (<a href=Zec.htm#v5_7>v. 7</a>), a lead weight, being thrown over the opening of the ephah vessel signifies the restriction of the wickedness in commerce by God&rsquo;s sovereignty."

BD[">X6\x97"]="<b>him</b><br> &emsp; Referring to Cyrus in <a href=Isa.htm#v44_28>44:28</a> and <a href=Isa.htm#v45_1>45:1</a>, typifying Christ as the Servant of Jehovah. God loves Israel, loves His kingdom, signified by the city of Jerusalem, and loves His house, signified by the temple. In subduing Babylon and releasing the captives of Israel, and in charging Israel and supporting them to build up the temple and the city of their God (<a href=Ezr.htm#v1>Ezra 1</a>), Cyrus did God&rsquo;s pleasure. Thus, God loved Cyrus. It was a matter of love for God to use a Gentile king to do what was in His heart."
BD["*))\x99"]="<b>Tent</b><br> &emsp; The tabernacle was God&rsquo;s dwelling place (<a href=Exo.htm#v40_34>Exo. 40:34</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v40_35>35</a>), and the Tent of Meeting was the place where God and His redeemed people met (cf. <a href=Exo.htm#v25_22>Exo. 25:22</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v33_7>33:7</a>). Both refer to the church, which is God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>) and also a meeting place for the saved ones to meet with the saving God (cf. <a href=1Co.htm#v14_23>1&nbsp;Cor. 14:23</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v14_25>25</a>)."
