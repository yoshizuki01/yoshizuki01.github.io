Satan, in his cruel nature, would attack God&rsquo;s lovers to any extent to damage them if God did not draw a line to preserve His lovers&rsquo; existence that they might gain Him to the fullest extent for His fullest satisfaction. After God judged Satan, God still allowed him to be free to accuse, attack, damage, persecute, and martyr His saints that God may use him to a certain extent for the fulfillment of His particular purpose (<a href=2Co.htm#v4_16>2&nbsp;Cor. 4:16</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v4_17>17</a>).
