BD["S,-\x97"]="<b>gathered</b><br> &emsp; This was a gathering of the Jewish Sanhedrin (<a href=Act.htm#v4_15>v. 15</a>). In the four Gospels this Sanhedrin, composed of the Jewish leaders, became the strongest opponent of the Lord Jesus and His ministry and condemned Him to death (<a href=Mat.htm#v26_59>Matt. 26:59</a>). Now, in this book, the same Sanhedrin, with the same constituents, began the persecution of the apostles and their ministry (<a href=Act.htm#v5_21>5:21</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v6_12>6:12</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v22_30>22:30</a>). This indicates that Judaism had fallen into the hand of God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan the devil, and was being used by him in his attempt to frustrate and even destroy God&rsquo;s move in His New Testament economy for the carrying out of His eternal purpose, that is, to bring His kingdom to the earth by establishing and building up the churches through the preaching of the gospel of Christ."
BD["P/?\x97"]="<b>wicked</b><br> &emsp; The wicked things that proceed from within are the evil issues of man&rsquo;s fallen and sinful nature (<a href=Mrk.htm#v7_21>v. 21</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v7_18>Rom. 7:18</a>)."

BD["S*3\x97"]="<b>tongues</b><br> &emsp; Gk. glossa, used for two things in this chapter: the speaking organ in <a href=Act.htm#v2_3>v. 3</a>, and dialects in this verse and <a href=Act.htm#v2_4>v. 4</a>, referring to the dialect in vv. <a href=Act.htm#v2_6>6</a> and <a href=Act.htm#v2_8>8</a>. This evidence leaves no ground for saying that tongue-speaking may be merely a voice or sound uttered by the tongue, the speaking organ; it must be a dialect, because what the disciples spoke in tongues (vv. <a href=Act.htm#v2_4>4</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v2_11>11</a>) were all different dialects (vv. <a href=Act.htm#v2_6>6</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v2_8>8</a>). In this sense, tongues and dialects are synonymous, used interchangeably in these verses."
BD["O2?\x97"]="<b>finish</b><br> &emsp; This word was not fulfilled by the twelve apostles&rsquo; preaching before Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion. It will not be fulfilled until the great tribulation (<a href=Mat.htm#v24_21>24:21</a>). The prediction in vv. <a href=Mat.htm#v10_17>17</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v10_23>23</a> is very similar to that in <a href=Mat.htm#v24_9>24:9</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v24_13>13</a>. Here the heavenly King sent the apostles to preach the gospel of the kingdom to the Jews. After His resurrection He sent His apostles to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. After the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, He will send His apostles to preach the gospel of the kingdom again to the Jews. At that time, this word will be fulfilled, and He will come."

BD["S)6\x97"]="<b>continued</b><br> &emsp; Before the Lord&rsquo;s death the disciples had no interest in praying for spiritual things (<a href=Luk.htm#v22_40>Luke 22:40</a>, <a href=Luk.htm#v22_45>45</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v22_46>46</a>); rather, they contended among themselves as to which of them was considered to be greatest (<a href=Luk.htm#v22_24>Luke 22:24</a>). But after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension, their spiritual condition changed radically. They did not contend among themselves but were burdened to continue steadfastly with one accord in prayer, even before the day of Pentecost, when they would receive the outpoured Spirit of power economically (<a href=Act.htm#v2>ch. 2</a>). This is a strong sign and proof that they had received the indwelling Spirit of life essentially on the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_22>John 20:22</a>). This is also evidence that they had been strengthened in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy by the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s ascension."

Eating unclean things may defile us. Eating is the way to partake of Christ (<a href=Mat.htm#v15_21>15:21</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v15_28>28</a>), and by eating we feed on the unlimited and inexhaustibly rich supply of Christ (<a href=Mat.htm#v15_32>15:32</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v15_39>39</a>).

BD["AXK\x97"]="<b>Jehovah</b><br> &emsp; At the end of this book God obtains a holy temple (chs. <a href=Ezk.htm#v40>40</a>&mdash;<a href=Ezk.htm#v44>44</a>) and a holy city in the Holy Land (chs. <a href=Ezk.htm#v47>47</a>&mdash;<a href=Ezk.htm#v48>48</a>). God dwells in the temple, and He dwells also in the city. In the temple God has fellowship with His people, and in the city God reigns among His people. This indicates that in the temple and the city God has come down from heaven to live with man. The temple and the city typify the church in the present age as the center for the fellowship with God and for the reigning of God (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_16>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:16</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_17>17</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v12_22>Heb. 12:22</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v12_23>23</a>). In the church as the temple and the city, which is in Christ as the good land, God has His expression, and God and His people enjoy one another mutually and have mutual satisfaction. The church as God&rsquo;s temple and God&rsquo;s city will ultimately consummate in the New Jerusalem for eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>Rev. 21:2</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_22>22</a>)."

It affords the apostles salvation and life and becomes the capacity and supply for their apostleship (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_9>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:9</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v15_10>10</a>)."
BD["-+8\x99"]="<b>crossed</b><br> &emsp; Israel&rsquo;s crossing the river Jordan typifies not the believers&rsquo; physical death but the believers&rsquo; experience of the death of Christ, in which their old man is terminated and buried (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_3>Rom. 6:3</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v6_6>6</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20</a>). Israel&rsquo;s entering into the good land after crossing the Jordan typifies not the believers&rsquo; going to heaven after they die but the believers&rsquo; experience of taking over the heavenlies, where Satan and his power of darkness are (see notes <a href=NumN.htm#n21_1x2>1<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Num.htm#v21>Num. 21</a> and <a href=EphN.htm#n6_12x4>12<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=Eph.htm#v6>Eph. 6</a>). Israel&rsquo;s crossing the Jordan and entering the good land are related to Israel&rsquo;s possessing and enjoying the good land, which typifies the believers&rsquo; practical experience of the riches of the blessings in Christ as revealed in the book of Ephesians.

BD["T),\x9a"]="<b>Spirit</b><br> &emsp; The Spirit of holiness here is in contrast to the flesh in <a href=Rom.htm#v1_3>v. 3</a>. As the flesh in <a href=Rom.htm#v1_3>v. 3</a> refers to the human nature of Christ in the flesh, so the Spirit in this verse does not refer to the person of the Holy Spirit of God but to the divine essence of Christ. This divine essence of Christ, being God the Spirit Himself (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_24>John 4:24</a>), the divinity of Christ, is of holiness, full of the nature and quality of being holy."
