BD["d+:\x9a"]="<b>To</b><br> &emsp; Referring to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Since such a praise is one that is rendered to our God (<a href=Rom.htm#v11_36>Rom. 11:36</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v16_27>16:27</a>), it indicates that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is God."
BD["d*>\x97"]="<b>dog</b><br> &emsp; Dogs and sows are unclean animals according to the ordinances of God&rsquo;s holiness (<a href=Lev.htm#v11_27>Lev. 11:27</a>, <a href=Lev.htm#v11_7>7</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v7_6>Matt. 7:6</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n7_6x2>note 2</a>). Dogs are accustomed to eating filthy things. They vomit what they eat and turn to their own vomit, becoming filthy inwardly. Sows wallow in the mud, making themselves filthy outwardly. The God-denying heretics eventually become like these dirty animals, making themselves filthy both inwardly and outwardly. (What serious judgment they deserve according to God&rsquo;s righteousness in His governmental administration!) Hence, they are very contagious, and the believers are prohibited from having contact with them (<a href=2Jo.htm#v9>2&nbsp;John 9</a>-<a href=2Jo.htm#v11>11</a>)."

BD["e-,\x97"]="<b>everything</b><br> &emsp; Referring to every person who has been begotten of God. Yet such an expression should refer especially to that part, i.e., the spirit of the regenerated person, that has been regenerated with the divine life (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_6>John 3:6</a>). The regenerated spirit of the regenerated believer does not practice sin (<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_9>3:9</a>) and overcomes the world. The believer&rsquo;s divine birth with the divine life is the basic factor for such victorious living."
BD["a58\x97"]="<b>sharing</b><br> &emsp; Lit., fellowshipping. Doing good refers to giving, and fellowshipping refers to sharing, i.e., having fellowship in the needs of the saints. This kind of doing good and fellowshipping with others also are sacrifices that we should offer to God. These too are necessary for a proper church life. It is truly improper if in the church some needy saints are not well cared for and ministered to. This means that the fellowshipping with others is absent or inadequate."

BD["e+2\x97"]="<b>In</b><br> &emsp; To practice or not practice sin, that is, to live in or not live in sin, is not a matter of behavior but of whose children we are, the children of God or the children of the devil. Hence, it is a matter of life and nature. Men, as fallen descendants of Adam, are born children of the devil, the evil one (<a href=Joh.htm#v8_44>John 8:44</a>), and possess his life, partake of his nature, and live in sin automatically and habitually. Practicing sin is their life. But the believers, who are redeemed from their fallen state and are reborn in their spirit, are the children of God, who possess His life, partake of His nature, and do not live in sin. Practicing righteousness is their life. Whether one is a child of God or a child of the devil is manifested by what he practices, righteousness or sin. A reborn believer may commit sin, and an unsaved man may do righteousness. Both are their outward behavior, not their outward living, and thus do not manifest what they are in their inward life and nature."
BD["e+1\x9a"]="<b>cannot</b><br> &emsp; I.e., cannot live in sin habitually. A regenerated believer may fall into sin occasionally, but the divine life as the divine seed in his regenerated nature will not allow him to live in sin. This is similar to a sheep: it may fall into the mud, but its clean life will not allow it to remain and wallow in the mud as a swine would."

BD["a2A\x97"]="<b>abandoning</b><br> &emsp; For the Hebrew believers, at their time and in their situation, to abandon their own assembling together would have been to abandon the new covenant way of contacting God, to abandon the church and return to their old religion&mdash;Judaism. This would have broken God&rsquo;s administration of grace, thus constituting a serious sin before God (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_26>v. 26</a>)."
