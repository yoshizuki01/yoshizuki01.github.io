These wars were a distress, a trial, to the children of Israel. This was especially true of the war that was waged by Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria, a descendant of one of the four successors of Alexander the Great and a full type of Antichrist. This was a severe trial sent by God to His chosen people because they had become corrupt after their return from captivity."
