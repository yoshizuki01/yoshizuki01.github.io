However, John said here that the message was that God is light. This indicates that the Lord Jesus is God, implying the essence of the Divine Trinity."

Through this word we were regenerated. It is God&rsquo;s living and abiding word of life that conveys God&rsquo;s life into our spirit for our regeneration."
BD["e*)\x9b"]="<b>Advocate</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word refers to one who is called to another&rsquo;s side to aid him; hence, a helper. It refers also to one who offers legal aid or one who intercedes on behalf of someone else; hence, an advocate, counsel, or intercessor. The word carries the sense of consoling and consolation; hence, a consoler, a comforter. It is used in the Gospel of John (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_16>14:16</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v14_26>26</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v15_26>15:26</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v16_7>16:7</a>) for the Spirit of reality as our Comforter within us, the One who takes care of our case or our affairs (see <a href=JohN.htm#n14_16x1>note 16<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Joh.htm#v14>John 14</a>). It is used here in reference to the Lord Jesus as our Advocate with the Father. When we sin, He, based on the propitiation that He accomplished, takes care of our case by interceding (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_34>Rom. 8:34</a>) and pleading for us."
BD["=03\x97"]="<b>Baal</b><br> &emsp; Meaning Lord of all. Solomon as a great lord who possessed many vineyards rented the vineyards to keepers in order to gain produce. The vineyard keepers would pay Solomon one thousand shekels. Each vineyard keeper had helpers to keep the fruit, and he had to pay them two hundred shekels (<a href=SoS.htm#v8_12>v. 12</a>). In the work of Christ, Christ is the Lord of all the works (vineyards). We, as Christ&rsquo;s lovers, are vineyard keepers, who participate in one part of Christ&rsquo;s work. According to the Lord&rsquo;s requirement, we should pay Him the one thousand shekels, i.e., pay Him what He requires. In our work with the Lord we do not have &ldquo;helpers&rdquo;; hence, we as the vineyard keepers are able to keep the fruit ourselves. Thus, instead of giving the two hundred shekels to others, we give it to ourselves. This is the same as the Lord giving us two hundred shekels as a reward. Verses <a href=SoS.htm#v8_11>11</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v8_12>12</a> show that our work with the Lord must exceed what He requires. The Lord requires not only what He has delivered to us but what He has given to us with interest (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_26>Matt. 25:26</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v25_27>27</a>). With this interest as the basis, the Lord will reward us when He comes back. This reward will be given not according to the Lord&rsquo;s grace but according to His righteousness.<br> &emsp; Christ as our Beloved is the Lord of all, possessing all things (<a href=Act.htm#v10_36>Acts 10:36</a>), and we as His lovers share in all His possessions (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_21>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:21</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_22>22</a>) freely in the grace of Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v3_24>Rom. 3:24</a>), which is the issue of the love of God (<a href=2Co.htm#v13_14>2&nbsp;Cor. 13:14</a>). Yet we as His lovers still should give Him as our Beloved what we should give, not as a duty but as a matter of love (cf. <a href=Gal.htm#v5_13>Gal. 5:13</a>). Christ as our Beloved, joining Himself to us as one, still likes to give us a reward of righteousness (<a href=2Ti.htm#v4_8>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:8</a>). This implies that Christ as our Beloved gives us a reward for the residue of our labor as an incentive to our faithfulness in our labor for Him in love (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v25_20>Matt. 25:20</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v25_23>23</a>); hence, it is a reward of righteousness."
