BD[")AK\x97"]="<b>calyx</b><br> &emsp; According to the description given in this chapter, in the divine thought the golden lampstand is actually a living and growing tree with calyxes and blossoms (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n25_31x1P1>note 31<sup>1</sup>, par. 1</a>). Thus, the lampstand portrays the Triune God embodied in Christ as a living tree, growing, branching, budding, and blossoming to shine the light for His full expression. The calyx under each pair of branches signifies life branching out by growing to produce the shining. The repetition in this verse related to the calyxes and the branches also indicates growth. As the central shaft, or stalk, of the lampstand grows upward, it produces three pairs of branches, and as the branches grow out, calyxes, buds, and blossoms appear on the branches (<a href=Exo.htm#v25_33>v. 33</a>). The light of the lampstand is the blossoming of the resurrection life (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_4>John 1:4</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v5_22>Gal. 5:22</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v5_9>Eph. 5:9</a>), and the shining of the light is the issue of the growing, branching, budding, and blossoming. That there are twenty-five calyxes and twenty-two blossoms indicates that with the lampstand the responsibility for growth is greater than the matter of budding, blossoming, and shining."

The Corinthians did much speaking in tongues, yet they still remained infants in Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_3>3</a>). However, the gifts developed in life require growth in life, even maturity, for the building up of the church. It was for this purpose that this Epistle was written to the Corinthians."
BD["T77\x8c"]="But I have written the more boldly to you on some points so as to remind you <I>of</I> <I>them</I> again because of the grace given to me by God"
BD["S1R\x8c"]="And it became known throughout all of Joppa and many believed on the Lord."
BD["Y*1\x8c"]="Therefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name,"
BD["OC\@\x8c"]="And Pilate, seeing that nothing was gained but rather that an uproar was taking place, took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of this man&rsquo;s blood. You see <I>to</I> <I>it</I> yourselves."

BD["Y*-\x98"]="<b>Christ</b><br> &emsp; In <a href=Phi.htm#v1>ch. 1</a> the central point is to magnify Christ, to live Christ (vv. <a href=Phi.htm#v2_20>20</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v2_21>21</a>). In <a href=Phi.htm#v2>ch. 2</a> it is to take Christ as our pattern, our model. This pattern is the standard of our salvation (<a href=Phi.htm#v2_12>v. 12</a>). In vv. <a href=Phi.htm#v2_5>5</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v2_16>16</a> there are four basic elements: Christ (<a href=Phi.htm#v2_5>v. 5</a>), salvation (<a href=Phi.htm#v2_12>v. 12</a>), God (<a href=Phi.htm#v2_13>v. 13</a>), and the word of life (<a href=Phi.htm#v2_16>v. 16</a>). The word of life works out the pattern by the operating God to apply salvation to our daily living. In this way we enjoy Christ and live Him, taking Him as our pattern."

BD[")I3\x97"]="<b>companion</b><br> &emsp; A companion, being more than a friend, is an associate, a partner, one who shares a common interest and a common enterprise.
