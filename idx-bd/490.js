The full knowledge of the Son of God is the apprehension of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience. The more we grow in life, the more we will cleave to the faith and to the apprehension of Christ, and the more we will drop all the minor and meaner doctrinal concepts that cause divisions.

The significances of the ingredients of this compound anointing oil are as follows: (1) flowing myrrh, a spice used in burial (<a href=Joh.htm#v19_39>John 19:39</a>), signifies the precious death of Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_3>Rom. 6:3</a>); (2) fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_13>Rom. 8:13</a>); (3) fragrant calamus, from a reed that grew upward in a marsh or muddy place, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_6>Eph. 2:6</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v3_1>Col. 3:1</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:3</a>); (4) cassia, used in ancient times to repel insects and snakes, signifies the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_10>Phil. 3:10</a>); and (5) the olive oil as the base of the compound ointment signifies the Spirit of God as the base of the compound Spirit (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_2>Gen. 1:2</a>). Since the number four signifies the creatures (<a href=Ezk.htm#v1_5>Ezek. 1:5</a>), of which man is the head (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_26>Gen. 1:26</a>), and the number one signifies the unique God (<a href=Deu.htm#v4_35>Deut. 4:35</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Tim. 2:5</a>), the four spices signify the humanity of Christ in God&rsquo;s creation, and the one hin of olive oil signifies the unique God with His divinity. Thus, the blending of olive oil with the four spices signifies the compounding, the mingling, of God and man, of divinity and humanity, in the compound Spirit (cf. <a href=Lev.htm#v2_4>Lev. 2:4</a> and <a href=LevN.htm#n2_4x3>note 3</a>). The olive oil and the four spices were all prepared through a process of either pressing or cutting, signifying that the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_9>Rom. 8:9</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n8_9x4>note 4</a>) through Christ&rsquo;s sufferings (<a href=Mat.htm#v26_36>Matt. 26:36</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n26_36x1>note</a>). Furthermore, the measure of the four spices, being three complete units of five hundred shekels each, the middle five hundred shekels being split into two parts, signifies the Triune God in resurrection, the second, the Son, being &ldquo;split&rdquo; by His death on the cross. Since in the Bible five is the number for responsibility (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_2>Matt. 25:2</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n25_2x1>note 1</a>), the five elements in the compound ointment and the three units of five hundred shekels of the four spices signify the Triune God in resurrection as the power, the capability, for bearing responsibility. Since the numbers three and five are related to God&rsquo;s building (see <a href=GenN.htm#n6_15x2>note 15<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v6>Gen. 6</a>), these numbers in the compound ointment signify that in the compound Spirit there is the element for God&rsquo;s building. Based on the above significances, the compounding of the four spices with the olive oil to make an anointing oil signifies the mingling of the above-mentioned elements with the Spirit of God through the process of Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to produce the compound Spirit for the building of God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place."

BD["+H)\x97"]="<b>Now</b><br> &emsp; The prearrangement of the distribution of the good land shown in the last five chapters of this book typifies the sharing of the enjoyment of the rich Christ. At this point God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people, after being formed into a priestly army to fight for God and to journey with God, were prepared by God to possess the good land, a type of the all-inclusive Christ as the portion allotted by God to the believers in Christ (see <a href=DeuN.htm#n8_7x1>note 7<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Deu.htm#v8>Deut. 8</a>)."

As believers, we all have God as our Father and Christ as our Lord. As females who are in the house of our Father and who have Christ as our Husband, we do not have the right to make the final decision concerning our vows. The final decision should be made either by God the Father or by Christ the Lord. This indicates that in relation to God the Father and Christ the Lord, the believers have lost their rights. Neither before God the Father nor before Christ the Lord do we have any rights (cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v1_1>Rom. 1:1</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n1_1x2P1>note 2, par. 1</a>)."

How could He have entered, having bones and flesh? Our limited mind cannot comprehend it, but it is a fact! We must receive it according to the divine revelation. This was a fulfillment of His promise in <a href=Joh.htm#v16_16>16:16</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v16_19>19</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v16_22>22</a>."

BD[",A5\x97"]="<b>differing</b><br> &emsp; The dishonest practice of having differing weights and measures is a lie and is surely from Satan (<a href=Joh.htm#v8_44>John 8:44</a>). In spiritual application, to condemn a certain thing in others while justifying the same thing in ourselves indicates that we have different weights and measures, i.e., different scales&mdash;one scale for measuring others and a different scale for measuring ourselves. In the house of God, the church (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>), only one scale should be used to weigh everyone. If we have only one scale, we will be fair, righteous, and just, even as God is, and we will keep the oneness and one accord in the church.
