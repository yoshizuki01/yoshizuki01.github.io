On the walls of the temple were the images of idols, and over the temple was the glory of the Lord. The glory of the Lord could not tolerate the images of the idols. Those images provoked God&rsquo;s jealousy. Because of the idols in the temple, the glory of God withdrew step by step, leaving first the temple, then the city, and finally the people (<a href=Ezk.htm#v9_3>9:3</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v10_19>10:19</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v11_23>11:23</a>).

Such a testimony will be strong, like the sound of great waters; moreover, it will be the voice of God Himself and the voice of an army fighting the battle for God&rsquo;s economy."

BD["\@-=\x97"]="<b>Turn</b><br> &emsp; This word, expressed as an imperative, indicates that Jeremiah considered that the responsibility for the turning of the children of Israel depended upon Jehovah. Although Jeremiah wrote here in a human way, his thought was correct. At the time of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, the Lord will turn to Israel and appear to them, and they will turn to Him and receive His household salvation (<a href=Zec.htm#v12_10>Zech. 12:10</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v11_26>Rom. 11:26</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v1_7>Rev. 1:7</a>)."
BD[">64\x97"]="<b>Daystar</b><br> &emsp; The Latin Vulgate translates, Lucifer.

Because of his rebellion, Lucifer as Satan was judged by God (vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v14_12>12</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v14_15>15</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v28_16>Ezek. 28:16</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v28_19>19</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v10_18>Luke 10:18</a>).<br> &emsp; In vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v14_12>12</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v14_15>15</a> Isaiah identifies Lucifer with Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon (<a href=Isa.htm#v14_4>v. 4</a>), thus regarding Nebuchadnezzar as a figure of Satan, as one who was one with Satan (cf. <a href=Ezk.htm#v28_12>Ezek. 28:12</a>). This unveils Satan&rsquo;s kingdom of darkness behind the nations (<a href=Eph.htm#v6_12>Eph. 6:12b</a>; cf. <a href=Dan.htm#v10_13>Dan. 10:13</a>, <a href=Dan.htm#v10_20>20</a>) and his oneness with the rulers of the nations."
