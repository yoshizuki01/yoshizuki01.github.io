BD["AJB\x97"]="<b>blessing</b><br> &emsp; In God&rsquo;s recovery by life, God&rsquo;s recovered people not only receive His blessing but also become a source of blessing to others that they may be supplied. Under the showers of blessing in season, there will be an abundance of spiritual food not only for us to enjoy but also for us to supply to others (vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v34_27>27a</a>, <a href=Ezk.htm#v34_29>29</a>)."

In the millennium the repentant Jews who are regenerated through the new covenant will be the priests to care for all the nations (<a href=Isa.htm#v2_2>Isa. 2:2</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v2_3>3</a>; <a href=Zec.htm#v8_20>Zech. 8:20</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v8_23>23</a>). For this they will need much refining and purifying. Therefore, in His second coming Christ will renew, sanctify, and transform Israel to be His refined and purified priests."
BD["()8\x99"]="<b>lesser</b><br> &emsp; The moon (<a href=Psa.htm#v136_9>Psa. 136:9</a>). In Joseph&rsquo;s dream his father was likened to the sun, his mother, to the moon, and his brothers, to the stars (<a href=Gen.htm#v37_9>37:9</a>). The moon can be considered a figure of the church, the wife of Christ (cf. <a href=SoS.htm#v6_10>S.S. 6:10</a>). The moon has no light of its own but shines in the night by reflecting the light of the sun. Likewise, the church shines in the dark night of the church age by reflecting the divine light of Christ (cf. <a href=Phi.htm#v2_15>Phil. 2:15</a>)."

In the tabernacle the boards of acacia wood standing upright also signify the humanity of the Lord Jesus (<a href=Exo.htm#v26_15>Exo. 26:15</a>). As a proper human being, the Lord Jesus is the standing and supporting wall of God&rsquo;s building."

The length of the porch is eight cubits (<a href=Ezk.htm#v40_9>v. 9</a>), the number eight signifying Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, which took place on the first day of a new week as a new beginning (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_1>John 20:1</a>). These dimensions signify that the Lord Jesus as a man, who is the gate of God&rsquo;s building, is fully in resurrection. They also signify that when we arrive at the porch, we are in resurrection, in a new beginning."
