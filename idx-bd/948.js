BD["c*1\x97"]="<b>race</b><br> &emsp; Race, priesthood, nation, and people are all collective nouns, referring to the believers corporately. As a race, we, the believers, are chosen; as a priesthood, a body of priests, we are royal, kingly; as a nation, we are holy; as a people, we are God&rsquo;s possession, a possession particularly acquired and owned by God as His treasure (<a href=Tit.htm#v2_14>Titus 2:14</a> and <a href=TitN.htm#n2_14x3>note 3</a>). Chosen race denotes our descent from God; royal priesthood, our service to God; holy nation, our being a community for God; and people acquired for a possession, our preciousness to God. These are all in a corporate sense. Hence, we need to be built together (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>v. 5</a>)."
BD[":\xa7+\x97"]="<b>children</b><br> &emsp; Instead of striving without trusting in the Lord, we should simply be a good father producing children. We cannot gain much by our toil, but we can produce spiritual children (cf. <a href=1Co.htm#v4_15>1&nbsp;Cor. 4:15</a>). In addition to His caring for us, God blesses us with increase, with children. Increase does not depend on what we do; it depends on how much God gives. Both the care and the blessing come from Him."

The sufferings of Christ, as revealed to the prophets and prophesied by them in <a href=Psa.htm#v22_1>Psa. 22:1</a>, <a href=Psa.htm#v22_6>6</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v22_8>8</a>, <a href=Psa.htm#v22_12>12</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v22_18>18</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v53_2>Isa. 53:2</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v53_10>10a</a>, <a href=Isa.htm#v53_12>12b</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v9_26>Dan. 9:26</a>; and <a href=Zec.htm#v12_10>Zech. 12:10m</a>; <a href=Zec.htm#v13_6>13:6</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v13_7>7</a>, are for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s redemption, which, on the negative side, has solved all the problems between man and God and terminated the old creation, and, on the positive side, has released the eternal life of God for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.<br> &emsp; The glories of Christ (see <a href=1PeN.htm#n1_11x6>note 6</a>) are for His glorification, which He asked of the Father before His crucifixion (<a href=Joh.htm#v17_1>John 17:1</a>) and which is for the executing of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. The sufferings of Christ and the glorification of Christ with the glories in different steps&mdash;the factors of God&rsquo;s full redemption and salvation&mdash;being applied to and experienced by us equal the salvation mentioned in vv. <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_5>5</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_9>9</a>, and <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_10>10</a>. This is what the prophets in the Old Testament sought and searched for diligently, what the Spirit of Christ revealed to them, what the apostles preached in the New Testament by the Holy Spirit, and what the angels long to look into (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_12>v. 12</a>)."

BD[":\xa6.\x97"]="<b>seed</b><br> &emsp; Referring, perhaps, to the captives. In a human sense, their captivity in foreign countries was a suffering. In a divine sense, however, it was a sowing through their preaching to the Gentiles concerning God. As a result, a number of Gentiles (sheaves) were brought to God through these captives. This indicates that the captives sowed the seed of the knowledge of God among the heathen. Cf. <a href=Rut.htm#v1_16>Ruth 1:16</a> and <a href=RutN.htm#n1_16x2>note 2</a>."

BD["d)+\x97"]="<b>divine</b><br> &emsp; <a href=2Pe.htm#v2>Chapter 2</a> shows that this Epistle, like 2&nbsp;Timothy, 2&nbsp;John, 3&nbsp;John, and Jude, was written in the time of the church&rsquo;s degradation and apostasy. Hence, apostasy was the background of this book. The burden of the writer was to inoculate the believers against the poison of apostasy. God&rsquo;s salvation is to impart Himself in His Trinity into the believers that He may be their life and life supply. This is God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s plan. The apostasy distracted the believers from the economy of God by leading them into the human logic of puzzling philosophies. This did not lead them to partake of the tree of life, which gives life, but to participate in the tree of knowledge, which brings in death (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>Gen. 2:9</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v2_16>16</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_17>17</a>). Thus the serpent deceived and seduced Eve (<a href=Gen.htm#v3_1>Gen. 3:1</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v3_6>6</a>). In order to inoculate against this death-poison, in his healing Epistle the apostle first prescribed the divine power as the strongest and most effective antidote. This provides the believers with all things related to the generating and supplying divine life (not the killing knowledge) and the God-expressing godliness (not the show of human wisdom). This rich divine provision, which is covered in detail in the succeeding verses (to <a href=2Pe.htm#v1_11>v. 11</a>), is more than sufficient to enable the believers to live a proper Christian life and overcome the satanic apostasy.<br> &emsp; Divine denotes the eternal, unlimited, and almighty divinity of God. Hence, divine power is the power of the divine life, which is related to the divine nature."
BD["d)*\x9a"]="<b>knowledge</b><br> &emsp; This refers to a thorough, experiential knowledge. The full knowledge of the Triune God is for our participation in and enjoyment of His divine life and divine nature. It is in contrast to the killing knowledge of the human logic of philosophy, which invaded the church in its apostasy."
