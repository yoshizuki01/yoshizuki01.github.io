The first section, vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v45_1>1</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v45_8>8</a>, is a praise concerning the King Himself, the second section, vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v45_9>9</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v45_15>15</a>, is a praise concerning the queen, the King&rsquo;s wife, and the third section, vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v45_16>16</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v45_17>17</a>, is a praise concerning the King&rsquo;s sons, the princes.<br> &emsp; Verses <a href=Psa.htm#v45_1>1</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v45_8>8</a> are the praise of Christ the King from four directions: His fairness (<a href=Psa.htm#v45_2>v. 2</a>), His victory (vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v45_3>3</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v45_5>5</a>), His kingdom (vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v45_6>6</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v45_7>7</a>), and His virtues (<a href=Psa.htm#v45_8>v. 8</a>). In this praise there are two balanced pairs: Christ&rsquo;s fairness and His victory, and Christ&rsquo;s kingdom and His virtues. Christ&rsquo;s fairness is balanced by His victory with its requirements (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v5_20>Matt. 5:20</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v25_14>25:14</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v25_30>30</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v15_2>John 15:2</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v15_6>6</a>), and His kingdom, the issue of His victory, is balanced by the sweetness of His virtues."

In vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v3_3>3</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v3_4>4</a> and <a href=Ezk.htm#v3_22>22</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v3_23>23</a> the house of David, the royal household, is likened to a cedar tree. First, a branch of this tree, Jehoiachin, was cut off (vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v3_3>3</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v3_4>4</a>, <a href=Ezk.htm#v3_12>12</a>; <a href=2Ch.htm#v36_8>2&nbsp;Chron. 36:8b</a>-<a href=2Ch.htm#v36_10>10a</a>). Later, another branch, Zedekiah, was set up and was also cut off (vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v3_13>13</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v3_21>21</a>; <a href=2Ch.htm#v36_10>2&nbsp;Chron. 36:10b</a>-<a href=2Ch.htm#v36_20>20</a>). According to vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v3_22>22</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v3_23>23</a> one twig, one tender branch, on the top of this cedar tree was cropped and was transplanted on a high and prominent mountain, and it became a magnificent cedar. This twig is Christ (cf. <a href=Isa.htm#v11_1>Isa. 11:1</a>). Christ, who was born as a descendant of the house of David (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_1>Matt. 1:1</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v1_3>Rom. 1:3</a>), is a tender branch of the cedar of David. As such a tender branch, He was &ldquo;cropped&rdquo; by being crucified. Man cropped this tender One, but God caused Him to resurrect and to ascend (<a href=Act.htm#v2_22>Acts 2:22</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v2_24>24</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v2_32>32</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v2_36>36</a>). In this way God planted Christ in a high place, and Christ became a majestic cedar under which many people will dwell. Although the house of David was cropped because of their corruption and thus became desolate and lowly, the day will come when they will be revived in Christ (<a href=Amo.htm#v9_11>Amos 9:11</a> and <a href=AmoN.htm#n9_11x1>note</a>). Because they will be joined to Christ, they will become majestic once again."

BD["B3G\x97"]="<b>profane</b><br> &emsp; The armies of Antiochus Epiphanes profaned the sanctuary, removed the daily sacrifice, and set up the abomination that desolates. Sacrifices, circumcision, and keeping the Sabbath were absolutely forbidden. Antiochus Epiphanes even went so far as to erect an altar to Zeus on the altar of burnt offering in the temple. Moreover, he set up his own image in the temple, sacrificed a sow on the altar, and sprinkled its blood in the temple. He forced the holy people to worship the idol and eat pork, and he seduced young men to commit fornication in the temple. In all these evils Antiochus Epiphanes typifies Antichrist, who will appear in the last week of the seventy weeks (<a href=Dan.htm#v9_27>9:27</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v13_1>Rev. 13:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v13_7>7</a>). See <a href=DanN.htm#n9_27x1>note 27<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Dan.htm#v9>ch. 9</a>.<br> &emsp; According to this book the great human image in <a href=Dan.htm#v2_31>2:31</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v2_45>45</a> destroys and desecrates the temple of God four times. The first time was by the head, Nebuchadnezzar (<a href=Dan.htm#v1_1>1:1</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v1_2>2</a>; <a href=2Ch.htm#v36_18>2&nbsp;Chron. 36:18</a>-<a href=2Ch.htm#v36_19>19</a>); the second time was by Antiochus Epiphanes, a descendant of one of the four generals of Alexander the Great&rsquo;s Grecian Empire (<a href=Dan.htm#v8_9>8:9</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v8_14>14</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v11_31>11:31</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v11_32>32</a>); the third time was by Titus, a prince of the Roman Empire, in A.D. 70 (<a href=Dan.htm#v9_26>9:26</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v24_2>Matt. 24:2</a>); and the fourth time will be by Antichrist, part of the ten toes of the restored Roman Empire, in the middle of the last seven years of this age (<a href=Dan.htm#v9_27>9:27</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v12_7>12:7</a>, <a href=Dan.htm#v12_11>11</a>). All these instances show that the center, the aim, and the goal of Satan&rsquo;s struggle against God is related to the temple, which typifies first Christ as God&rsquo;s embodiment (<a href=Joh.htm#v2_19>John 2:19</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v2_21>21</a>) and then the church, the Body of Christ, as the enlargement of Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_16>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:16</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_17>17</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_20>Eph. 2:20</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>22</a>). God desires to have a place on earth where His people can worship Him, as a testimony that He still has an interest on this earth; but Satan is always struggling to destroy this place (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v2_19>John 2:19</a>). Ultimately, as revealed in the New Testament, Satan will be fully destroyed (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_10>Rev. 20:10</a>), and the church as God&rsquo;s house (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5</a>), the mingling of God with His redeemed people, will be fully built up in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the center of the new heaven and the new earth for eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v21>Rev. 21</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v22>22</a>)."

This means that the overcomers will be raptured to the heavens before the harvest, just as the firstfruits of the good land were reaped and brought into the temple of God before the harvest (<a href=Lev.htm#v23_10>Lev. 23:10</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v23_11>11</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v23_19>Exo. 23:19</a>).
