BD["e-.\x97"]="<b>He</b><br> &emsp; He, Jesus Christ, came as the Son of God that we might be born of God and have the divine life (<a href=Joh.htm#v10_10>John 10:10</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v20_31>20:31</a>). It is in His Son that God gives us eternal life (vv. <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_11>11</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_13>13</a>). Jesus, the man of Nazareth, was attested to be the Son of God by the water He went through in His baptism (<a href=Mat.htm#v3_16>Matt. 3:16</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v3_17>17</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_31>John 1:31</a>), by the blood He shed on the cross (<a href=Joh.htm#v19_31>John 19:31</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v19_35>35</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v27_50>Matt. 27:50</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v27_54>54</a>), and also by the Spirit He gave not by measure (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_32>John 1:32</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_34>34</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_34>3:34</a>). By these three God has testified that Jesus is His Son given to us (vv. <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_7>7</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_10>10</a>), that in Him we may receive His eternal life by believing into His name (vv. <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_11>11</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_13>13</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_16>John 3:16</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v3_36>36</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v20_31>20:31</a>). The water of baptism terminates people of the old creation by burying them; the blood shed on the cross redeems those whom God has chosen from among the old creation; and the Spirit, who is the truth, the reality in life (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_2>Rom. 8:2</a>), germinates those whom God has redeemed out of the old creation, by regenerating them with the divine life. Thus they are born of God and become His children (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_5>John 3:5</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v3_15>15</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_12>1:12</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_13>13</a>) and live a life that practices the truth (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_6>1:6</a>), the will of God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_17>2:17</a>), the righteousness of God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_29>2:29</a>), and the love of God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_10>3:10</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_11>11</a>) for His expression."

BD["f)1\x97"]="<b>goes</b><br> &emsp; Lit., leads forward (in a negative sense); i.e., goes further than what is right, advances beyond the limit of orthodox teaching concerning Christ. This is in contrast to abiding in the teaching of Christ. The Cerinthian Gnostics, who boasted of their advanced thinking concerning the teaching of Christ, practiced this. They went beyond the teaching of the divine conception of Christ, thus denying the deity of Christ. Consequently, they could not have God in salvation and in life."
BD["f)0\x9a"]="<b>reward</b><br> &emsp; According to the context, especially <a href=2Jo.htm#v9>v. 9</a>, the full reward must be the Father and the Son as the full enjoyment to the faithful believers, who abide in the truth concerning the person of Christ and do not deviate from it under the influence of the heresies regarding Christ. This interpretation is justified by the fact that there is no indication that this reward will be given in the future, as will the rewards mentioned in <a href=Mat.htm#v5_12>Matt. 5:12</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v16_27>16:27</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v3_8>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:8</a>, <a href=1Co.htm#v3_13>13</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_14>14</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_35>Heb. 10:35</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_36>36</a>; and <a href=Rev.htm#v11_18>Rev. 11:18</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_12>22:12</a>. If we would not be led astray by the heresies but would abide faithfully in the truth concerning the wonderful and all-inclusive Christ, who is both God and man, both our Creator and our Redeemer, we will enjoy in Him the Triune God to the fullest extent as our full reward, even today on earth."
