BD["e))\x97"]="<b>That</b><br> &emsp; Paul&rsquo;s ministry was to complete the divine revelation (<a href=Col.htm#v1_25>Col. 1:25</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v1_27>27</a>) of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, that is, the Triune God in Christ as the life-giving Spirit producing the members of Christ for the constituting and the building up of the Body of Christ, that the Triune God may have a full expression&mdash;the fullness of God (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>Eph. 1:23</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v3_19>3:19</a>)&mdash;in the universe. Paul&rsquo;s writings were completed around A.D. 67. Paul&rsquo;s completing ministry was damaged by the apostasy preceding and following his death. Then after a quarter of a century, around A.D. 90, John&rsquo;s writings came forth. John&rsquo;s ministry was not only to mend the broken ministry of Paul but also to consummate the entire divine revelation of both the Old Testament and the New Testament, of both the Gospels and the Epistles. In such a ministry, the focus is the mysteries of the divine life. John&rsquo;s Gospel, as the consummation of the Gospels, unveils the mysteries of the person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ. John&rsquo;s Epistles (especially the first), as the consummation of the Epistles, unfold the mystery of the fellowship of the divine life, which is the fellowship of God&rsquo;s children with God the Father and with one another. Then John&rsquo;s Revelation, as the consummation of the New Testament and the Old Testament, reveals the mystery of Christ as the life supply to God&rsquo;s children for His expression and as the center of the universal administration of the Triune God. Here John used the expression that which to open his Epistle and unfold the mystery of the fellowship in the divine life. That he did not use personal pronouns in reference to the Lord implies that what he was about to unfold is mysterious."
