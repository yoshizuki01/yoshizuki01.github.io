The title Nazarene may refer to the branch in <a href=Isa.htm#v11_1>Isa. 11:1</a>, which in Hebrew is netzer. The branch there, signifying Christ, is a sprout from the stump of Jesse, the father of David. By the time Jesus was born, the throne of David had been overthrown. This means that the royal stem of David had been cut off. Now a new sprout came forth from the stump of Jesse and grew out of his roots. The emerging and growing of this sprout were in a situation of humiliation. Jesus was not born in a recognized and honored royal home, nor did He grow up in a renowned city such as Jerusalem. Rather, He was born in a poor home and grew up in a despised town. All this made Him a Nazarene, a branch&mdash;not a lofty branch of a stately tree, but a seemingly insignificant sprout from the stump of Jesse."
