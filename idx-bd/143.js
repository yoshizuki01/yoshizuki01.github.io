BD["a.<\x97"]="<b>Forerunner</b><br> &emsp; As the Forerunner, the Lord Jesus took the lead to pass through the stormy sea and enter the heavenly haven to be the High Priest for us according to the order of Melchizedek. As such a Forerunner, He is the Author of our salvation (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_10>2:10</a>). As the Forerunner, He cut the way to glory, and as the Author, He entered into glory."
BD["d*-\x97"]="<b>righteousness</b><br> &emsp; Whether one is righteous and godly or unrighteous and ungodly is crucial in regard to God&rsquo;s governmental judgment (vv. <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_5>5</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_9>9</a>). To be righteous is to be right with man before God, and to be godly is to express God before man. This was the manner of life that Noah and Lot lived, a manner of life that spared them from God&rsquo;s governmental judgment according to His righteousness."
BD["b)B\x97"]="<b>religious</b><br> &emsp; In Greek, religious (adjective) and religion (noun) refer to ceremonial service and worship to God (implying the fear of God). The adjective is used only here. The noun is used in a positive sense here and in <a href=Jam.htm#v1_27>v. 27</a>, in a negative sense in <a href=Col.htm#v2_18>Col. 2:18</a> (for worship), and in a general sense in <a href=Act.htm#v26_5>Acts 26:5</a>. James&rsquo;s writing concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is not as striking as Paul&rsquo;s, Peter&rsquo;s, and John&rsquo;s. Paul focuses on Christ living and being formed in us (<a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v4_19>4:19</a>) and Christ being magnified in us and lived out of us (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_20>Phil. 1:20</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>21</a>) that we as the church, His Body, may become His fullness, His expression (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_22>Eph. 1:22</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>23</a>). Peter stresses the fact that God regenerated us through the resurrection of Christ (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:3</a>), making us partakers of His divine nature, that we may live a life of godliness (<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_3>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:3</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_7>7</a>) and be built up as a spiritual house to express His virtues (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_9>9</a>). John emphasizes the eternal life, given to us for our fellowship with the Triune God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_2>1&nbsp;John 1:2</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_3>3</a>), and the divine birth, which brings into us the divine life as the divine seed that we may live out a life that is like God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_29>1&nbsp;John 2:29</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_9>3:9</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v4_17>4:17</a>) and be the church, a lampstand, which bears the testimony of Jesus (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_9>Rev. 1:9</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v1_11>11</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v1_12>12</a>) and which will consummate in the New Jerusalem for God&rsquo;s expression unto eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>Rev. 21:2</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_10>10</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_11>11</a>). Of the matters that are characteristic of the New Testament, James stresses only God&rsquo;s begetting of us (<a href=Jam.htm#v1_18>v. 18</a>), the indwelling Spirit (<a href=Jam.htm#v4_5>4:5</a>), and a minor aspect of the church (<a href=Jam.htm#v5_14>5:14</a>). He does not speak of Christ as our life or of the church as the expression of Christ, the two most outstanding and dispensational characteristics of the New Testament. This Epistle shows that James must have been very religious. It might have been because of this and his practical Christian perfection that he was reputed to be, along with Peter and John, a pillar, even the first, in the church at Jerusalem (<a href=Gal.htm#v2_9>Gal. 2:9</a>). However, he was not strong in the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in Christ but was still under the influence of the background of the old Judaic religion, the primary elements of which were to worship God by ceremonies and to live a life in the fear of God. This is proved by the words in <a href=Act.htm#v21_20>Acts 21:20</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v21_24>24</a> and in <a href=Jam.htm#v2_2>2:2</a>-<a href=Jam.htm#v2_11>11</a> of this Epistle. Because his spiritual sight was covered by Judaism, he could not fully enter into the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy as Paul, Peter, and John were able to do."
BD["d*,\x9a"]="<b>judgment</b><br> &emsp; The judgment of the great day (<a href=Jud.htm#v6>Jude 6</a>), which probably will be the judgment of the great white throne, executed upon all the dead and the demons, and probably also upon the fallen angels (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_11>Rev. 20:11</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_15>15</a>). It is logical that all the angels, demons, and men who have joined Satan in his rebellion will be judged at the same time, in the same way, and with the same result, immediately after their evil leader is judged and cast into the lake of fire (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_10>Rev. 20:10</a>), into which they also will be cast.

BD["a4)\x9a"]="<b>sin</b><br> &emsp; Sin here refers mainly to the thing that entangles us and prevents us from running the race, just as the willful sin mentioned in <a href=Heb.htm#v10_26>10:26</a> would have kept the Hebrew believers away from the new covenant way in God&rsquo;s economy. (See <a href=HebN.htm#n10_26x1>note 26<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v10>ch. 10</a>.) Both the encumbering weight and the entangling sin would have frustrated the Hebrew believers and restrained them from running the heavenly race in the new covenant way of following Jesus, who was rejected by Judaism."

He begot us with life inwardly that we might have His holy nature; He disciplines us with judgment outwardly that we may partake of His holiness (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_9>Heb. 12:9</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v12_10>10</a>). His judgment is according to our work, our conduct, without respect of persons. Hence, we should pass the time of our sojourning in fear.

Peter used both to confirm and strengthen his writings as an inoculation against the heretical teachings in the apostasy. In his first Epistle, concerning the full salvation of God, he referred to both the prophets and the apostles (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_9>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:9</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_12>12</a>). Then in the second Epistle, concerning the shining of the divine truth, he again referred to both (<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_12>1:12</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_21>21</a>). Here, for the third time, he did the same."
