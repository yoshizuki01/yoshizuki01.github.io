Holiness is mainly toward God, and righteousness is mainly toward men.

BD["T7.\x97"]="<b>with</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means with the same mind, will, and purpose. This is to be one in our whole being and results in our being one in our outward speaking. Whenever we are in one accord, we speak the same thing; we speak with one mouth. This oneness is the reverse of Babel, where the division among mankind caused their language to become confused and divided into many different speakings (<a href=Gen.htm#v11_7>Gen. 11:7</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v11_9>9</a>).

It is of God that Christ died to save us from death that we might live to Him. It is of God that we have become a new creation in Christ. It is of God that Christ was made sin for us that we might become God&rsquo;s righteousness in Him. It is of God that He reconciled the world to Himself. And it is of God that the apostles are made ambassadors of Christ, commissioned to represent Him for the reconciling of men to God, that men may become God&rsquo;s righteousness and a new creation for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose."

This was according to God&rsquo;s ordination that Samuel should go before His anointed continually to supervise the king, observing what the king was doing. This indicates that Samuel, the acting God on earth, was greater than the king. Samuel could be qualified to such an extent because for many years God had been perfecting him uniquely for His economy."
BD["S0L\x97"]="<b>water</b><br> &emsp; This indicates that Philip preached water baptism to the eunuch. In this gospel case, water baptism was particularly emphasized, but no mention was made of Spirit baptism. This should give us strong instruction that we must pay attention to water baptism, which signifies the believers&rsquo; identification with Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_3>Rom. 6:3</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v6_5>5</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v2_12>Col. 2:12</a>), as well as to Spirit baptism. Spirit baptism produces the reality of the believers&rsquo; union with Christ in life essentially and in power economically, whereas water baptism is the believers&rsquo; affirmation of the Spirit&rsquo;s reality. Both are needed (cf. <a href=Act.htm#v10_47>10:47</a>), and neither can replace the other. All believers in Christ should properly have both, just as the children of Israel were baptized in the cloud (signifying the Spirit) and in the sea (signifying water)&mdash;<a href=1Co.htm#v10_2>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:2</a>.
