Our spirit was saved through regeneration (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_5>John 3:5</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_6>6</a>). Our body will be saved, redeemed, through the coming transfiguration (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_21>Phil. 3:21</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_23>Rom. 8:23</a>). Our soul will be saved through sufferings into the full enjoyment of the Lord at His revelation, His coming back. For this we must deny our soul, our soulish life, with all its pleasures in this age, that we may gain it in the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming age (<a href=Mat.htm#v10_37>Matt. 10:37</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v10_39>39</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v16_24>16:24</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_27>27</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v17_30>Luke 17:30</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v17_33>33</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v12_25>John 12:25</a>). At the Lord&rsquo;s revelation, through His judgment seat, some believers will enter into the joy of the Lord (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_21>Matt. 25:21</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v25_23>23</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v24_45>24:45</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v24_46>46</a>) and some will suffer in weeping and gnashing of teeth (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_30>Matt. 25:30</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v24_51>24:51</a>). To enter into the Lord&rsquo;s joy is the salvation of our souls (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_39>Heb. 10:39</a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n10_39x3>note 3</a>).
