BD["i;1\x97"]="<b>marriage</b><br> &emsp; The marriage dinner of the Lamb here is the wedding feast in <a href=Mat.htm#v22_2>Matt. 22:2</a>. It will be a reward to the overcoming believers. Only the overcomers will be called to it; not all the saved ones will participate in it. The five foolish virgins in <a href=Mat.htm#v25_8>Matt. 25:8</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v25_13>13</a> will miss it. However, after being dealt with by the Lord in the kingdom age, they will participate in the New Jerusalem for eternity. Hence, to be called to the marriage dinner of Christ, which will usher the overcoming believers into the enjoyment of the millennium, is to be blessed. The overcoming believers, who will be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb, will also be the bride of the Lamb."

The cargo is of seven categories: (1) ornaments, from gold to pearls; (2) clothing, from fine linen to scarlet; (3) furniture and decorations, from thyine wood to marble; (4) spices, from cinnamon to frankincense; (5) food, from wine to sheep; (6) transportation, horses and chariots; and (7) employment, slaves and souls of men."

BD["i=+\x97"]="<b>tabernacle</b><br> &emsp; As God&rsquo;s habitation, the New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle of God with men for eternity.

That type was first fulfilled in Christ as God&rsquo;s tabernacle among men (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>) and will eventually be fulfilled in the fullest way in the New Jerusalem, which will be the enlargement of Christ as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This tabernacle will also be the eternal dwelling place of God&rsquo;s redeemed people. God will overshadow us with Christ. (See <a href=RevN.htm#n7_15x3>note 15<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v7>ch. 7</a>.) Hence, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual habitation for both God and us."
