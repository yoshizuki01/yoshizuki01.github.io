BD["e)+\x99"]="<b>fellowship</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means joint participation, common participation. Fellowship is the issue of the eternal life and is actually the flow of the eternal life within all the believers, who have received and possess the divine life. It is illustrated by the flow of the water of life in the New Jerusalem (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>Rev. 22:1</a>). All genuine believers are in this fellowship (<a href=Act.htm#v2_42>Acts 2:42</a>). It is carried on by the Spirit in our regenerated spirit. Hence, it is called &ldquo;the fellowship of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (<a href=2Co.htm#v13_14>2&nbsp;Cor. 13:14</a>) and &ldquo;fellowship of [our] spirit&rdquo; (<a href=Phi.htm#v2_1>Phil. 2:1</a>). It is in this fellowship of the eternal life that we, the believers, participate in all that the Father and the Son are and have done for us; that is, we enjoy the love of the Father and the grace of the Son by virtue of the fellowship of the Spirit (<a href=2Co.htm#v13_14>2&nbsp;Cor. 13:14</a>). Such a fellowship was first the apostles&rsquo; portion in their enjoyment of the Father and the Son through the Spirit. Hence, in <a href=Act.htm#v2_42>Acts 2:42</a> it is called &ldquo;the fellowship of the apostles,&rdquo; and in this verse &ldquo;our [the apostles&rsquo;] fellowship,&rdquo; a fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. It is a divine mystery. This mysterious fellowship of the eternal life should be considered the subject of this Epistle.<br> &emsp; Fellowship here indicates a putting away of private interests and a joining with others for a certain common purpose. Hence, to have fellowship with the apostles, to be in the fellowship of the apostles, and to have fellowship with the Triune God in the apostles&rsquo; fellowship is to put aside our private interests and join with the apostles and the Triune God for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s purpose. This purpose, according to John&rsquo;s subsequent writings, is twofold: (1) that the believers grow in the divine life by abiding in the Triune God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_12>2:12</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_27>27</a>) and, based on the divine birth, live a life of the divine righteousness and the divine love (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_28>2:28</a>&mdash;<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_3>5:3</a>) to overcome the world, death, sin, the devil, and idols (<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_4>5:4</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_21>21</a>); and (2) that the local churches be built up as the lampstands for the testimony of Jesus (<a href=Rev.htm#v1>Rev. 1</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v3>3</a>) and consummate in the New Jerusalem as the full expression of God for eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v21>Rev. 21</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v22>22</a>). Our participation in the apostles&rsquo; enjoyment of the Triune God is our joining with them and with the Triune God for His divine purpose, which is common to God, the apostles, and all the believers."
