The context of this verse and the next verse, which include phrases such as each one of you, in sanctification and honor, and especially not in the passion of lust, justifies the interpretation of the first school but not that of the second. Here the apostle considered man&rsquo;s body his vessel, just as David did in <a href=1Sa.htm#v21_5>1&nbsp;Sam. 21:5</a>. In the same matter concerning the use of the body, both Paul and David considered man&rsquo;s body his vessel. To keep, or preserve, man&rsquo;s vessel in sanctification and honor, not allowing it to indulge in the passion of lust, is the safeguard against committing fornication."

Two matters are covered here: the Lord&rsquo;s parousia (presence) and our gathering together (rapture) to Him. The Lord&rsquo;s parousia will begin with the rapture of the overcomers to the throne of God in heaven (<a href=Rev.htm#v12_5>Rev. 12:5</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v12_6>6</a>); at the end of the great tribulation, which will occur in the last three and a half years of this age, the second half of the last week in <a href=Dan.htm#v9_27>Dan. 9:27</a> (<a href=Mat.htm#v24_21>Matt. 24:21</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n24_21x1>note</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v11_2>Rev. 11:2</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n11_2x4>note 4</a>), it will come to the air (<a href=Rev.htm#v10_1>Rev. 10:1</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n10_1x2>note 2</a>) and last for a time; and it will end with its manifestation, &ldquo;the manifestation of His parousia&rdquo; (<a href=2Th.htm#v2_8>v. 8</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v24_30>Matt. 24:30</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n24_30x4>note 4</a>). During the time in which the Lord&rsquo;s parousia remains in the air, the majority of the believers will be raptured to meet the Lord there (<a href=1Th.htm#v4_17>1&nbsp;Thes. 4:17</a>). According to the context, the day of the Lord in <a href=2Th.htm#v2_2>v. 2</a> refers to the day of the Lord&rsquo;s parousia (coming), in which the rapture of the majority of the believers will occur. <a href=2Th.htm#v2_3>Verse 3</a> tells us affirmatively that before that day Antichrist will be revealed to play the major role in the great tribulation (<a href=2Th.htm#v2_4>v. 4</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v13_1>Rev. 13:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v13_8>8</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v13_12>12</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v13_15>15</a>). This reveals clearly and definitely that the Lord&rsquo;s coming (parousia) to the air and the rapture of the majority of the believers cannot take place before the great tribulation."

BD["6-)\x97"]="<b>prophets</b><br> &emsp; The rebuilding work continued through the encouragement and help of the prophesying of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah (vv. <a href=Ezr.htm#v5_1>1</a>-<a href=Ezr.htm#v5_2>2</a>). In God&rsquo;s theocratic administration among the people of Israel, there were three offices: the priests, the kings, and the prophets. The responsibility of the high priest was to bring the matters concerning God&rsquo;s people into God&rsquo;s presence and wait on God for His instant speaking through the Urim and the Thummim (<a href=Exo.htm#v28_30>Exo. 28:30</a> and <a href=ExoN.htm#n28_30x1>notes</a>). The high priest then passed on God&rsquo;s decision and instructions to the king, who was responsible in God&rsquo;s administration to carry them out. Whenever the priests and the kings became weak and inadequate, God raised up the prophets to speak for Him in order to strengthen and assist the priesthood and the kingship (<a href=1Sa.htm#v3_11>1&nbsp;Sam. 3:11</a>-<a href=1Sa.htm#v3_21>21</a>; <a href=2Sa.htm#v12_1>2&nbsp;Sam. 12:1</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v12_25>25</a>). See <a href=NumN.htm#n27_21x1>note 21<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Num.htm#v27>Num. 27</a> and <a href=DeuN.htm#n16_18x1>note 18<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Deu.htm#v16>Deut. 16</a>.<br> &emsp; For the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth, the ministries of both the priesthood and the kingship are needed. The tabernacle was raised up through Aaron, the high priest, and Moses, representing the divine authority; the temple was built under the high priest and Solomon the king; the rebuilding of the temple was accomplished through the priesthood of Joshua and the authority of Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah (<a href=Hag.htm#v1_1>Hag. 1:1</a>). In the building of the recovered temple both Joshua and Zerubbabel became somewhat weak and discouraged. Therefore, God used the prophets Haggai and Zechariah to speak for Him and to strengthen and encourage Joshua and Zerubbabel (see the books of Haggai and Zechariah).<br> &emsp; In God&rsquo;s economy the priesthood and the kingship will remain forever (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_3>Rev. 22:3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>5</a>), whereas in the age of the millennium and in eternity the prophethood will not be needed (<a href=Dan.htm#v9_24>Dan. 9:24</a> and <a href=DanN.htm#n9_24x4>note 4</a>)."
