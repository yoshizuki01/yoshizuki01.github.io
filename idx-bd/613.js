This is the second time in Israel&rsquo;s history that this happened. At Mount Sinai, when the tabernacle was erected, the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle (<a href=Exo.htm#v40_34>Exo. 40:34</a>). Later, during the time of Eli the people of Israel fought against the Philistines with the Ark in a superstitious way and were defeated. The Ark was captured, and the glory of the Lord left the tabernacle (<a href=1Sa.htm#v4>1&nbsp;Sam. 4</a>). This means that the Lord gave up the tabernacle. When the temple was built at the time of Solomon, the glory of the Lord returned to fill the temple (<a href=1Ki.htm#v8_10>1&nbsp;Kings 8:10</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v8_11>11</a>). The glory of the Lord remained there until the time when Ezekiel saw it departing, leaving the temple and the city, resting on the Mount of Olives, the place from which the Lord Jesus ascended (<a href=Act.htm#v1_9>Acts 1:9</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v1_12>12</a>), and finally returning to the heavens.
