Peter and John were sent to Samaria not only to confirm the preaching of the gospel by Philip, one of the seven appointed to serve tables, but also to bring the church in Samaria, composed of Samaritans, with whom the Jews had no dealings, into identification with the Body of Christ by laying their hands on them. The Holy Spirit honored this laying on of hands and fell upon the Samaritans, signifying their identification with the Body of Christ. In this way the Samaritan believers received the Holy Spirit economically in addition to their having received the Holy Spirit essentially when they believed in the Lord Jesus."

The cup signifies that His death was the portion given to Him by God, the portion He took to redeem sinners for God.

This is the surpassing righteousness of the overcoming believers, mentioned in <a href=Mat.htm#v5_20>5:20</a> (see <a href=MatN.htm#n5_20x1>note 1</a> there).

This falling short of God&rsquo;s glory and expression is sin. Sinners are not only under the requirements of God&rsquo;s holiness and righteousness but also under the demand of God&rsquo;s glory.

Hence, a difference has arisen between the kingdom of the heavens and its outward appearance.

It lasted for seven days, a period of completion, signifying the entire period of our Christian life, from the day of our conversion to the day of rapture. This is a long feast, which we must keep not with the sin of our old nature, the old leaven, but with unleavened bread, which is the Christ of our new nature as our nourishment and enjoyment. Only He is the life supply of sincerity and truth, absolutely pure, without mixture, and full of reality. The feast is a time for the enjoyment of the banquet.
