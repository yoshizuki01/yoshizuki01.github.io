BD[":1,\x97"]="<b>judging</b><br> &emsp; David&rsquo;s thought here and in vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v9_7>7</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v9_8>8</a> is that God sits as the King on the throne only to judge the world in righteousness and with equity, i.e., with justice. His concept is according to the law and according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In contrast, the principal concept of the New Testament is that Christ rules the world to save the world in mercy and grace (<a href=Act.htm#v5_31>Acts 5:31</a> and <a href=ActN.htm#n5_31x2>note 2</a>). In the New Testament God&rsquo;s throne is mainly the throne of grace (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_16>Heb. 4:16</a>), the throne of a loving Savior, not the throne of judgment. From eternity to eternity God&rsquo;s intention is to love the world, which is composed of fallen men, and to favor man with His mercy and grace (<a href=Hos.htm#v6_6>Hosea 6:6</a>, cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v9_13>Matt. 9:13</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_16>John 3:16</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v2_3>1&nbsp;Tim. 2:3</a>-<a href=1Ti.htm#v2_4>4</a>; <a href=Tit.htm#v3_4>Titus 3:4</a>-<a href=Tit.htm#v3_7>7</a>). Of course, the New Testament also reveals that God&rsquo;s throne is the throne of God&rsquo;s authority and that God will judge His own people and the world in His righteousness (<a href=2Ti.htm#v4_8>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:8</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v4_17>1&nbsp;Pet. 4:17</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v3_19>Rom. 3:19</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v4_2>Rev. 4:2</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v6_12>6:12</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v20_15>20:15</a>)."

BD["=))\x97"]="<b>Song</b><br> &emsp; Song of Songs is a history of love in an excellent marriage, a story of the love between the wise King Solomon, the writer of this book, and the Shulammite (<a href=SoS.htm#v6_13>6:13</a>), a girl of the countryside. As such, this book is a marvelous and vivid portrait, in poetic form, of the bridal love between Christ as the Bridegroom and His lovers as His bride (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_29>John 3:29</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_30>30</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v19_7>Rev. 19:7</a>) in their mutual enjoyment in the mingling of His divine attributes with the human virtues of His lovers. Song of Songs stresses not the Body of Christ corporately but the believer in Christ individually, unveiling the progressive experience of an individual believer&rsquo;s loving fellowship with Christ in four stages, as shown in points I through IV of the outline of this book. The correspondence between the progression in the poem and the progression in the experience of Christ&rsquo;s lovers is the intrinsic revelation of the holy Word of the omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent God. The stages of such a progression should be landmarks to us in the course of our pursuing of Christ for His and our mutual satisfaction.<br> &emsp; In the romance between the great King Solomon and the girl from the countryside (cf. vv. <a href=SoS.htm#v1_5>5</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v1_8>8</a>), because the two did not match each other, the king became a &ldquo;country man&rdquo; in order to go to her village to court her, to gain her love. On the one hand, he made himself the same as the country girl; on the other hand, he made the country girl a queen. This is a type of the story of God&rsquo;s romance with man. God as the Husband is divine, and the wife He desires to marry is human; the two do not match each other. To fulfill His heart&rsquo;s desire God became a lowly man with humanity in incarnation, and He contacted man by the way of a romance. Then in His resurrection He uplifted His humanity into His divinity in the divine power according to the Spirit of holiness, and He was designated the Son of God in His humanity (<a href=Rom.htm#v1_3>Rom. 1:3</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v1_4>4</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n1_3x1>notes</a>). Today He as the universal Bridegroom is the God-man, having both divinity and humanity. In order to make His bride, His wife, the same as He is, He regenerates His human elect, putting His divinity into their humanity and uplifting their humanity to the standard of divinity (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:3</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_23>23</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_6>John 3:6</a>). After regenerating them, He then transforms His loving seekers gradually in their soul, and ultimately He transfigures them in their body, until in their entire being they are the same as He is in life, in nature, in image, and in function, but not in His Godhead (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_2>Rom. 12:2</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_18>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v3_21>Phil. 3:21</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_2>1&nbsp;John 3:2</a>). The romance in Song of Songs portrays the process through which the seeker of Christ passes in order to become the Shulammite, a duplication of Solomon and a figure of the New Jerusalem. See <a href=SoSN.htm#n6_13x1>note 13<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=SoS.htm#v6>ch. 6</a>."
