BD["i+-\x99"]="<b>erase</b><br> &emsp; The entire verse is the Lord&rsquo;s promise to the overcomers. It will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom after the Lord comes back. That a name is erased out of the book of life indicates that that name has already been written in the book of life. The book of life is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings that God has prepared for them. The names of all the saints chosen by God and predestinated to partake of these blessings are written in this book (<a href=Luk.htm#v10_20>Luke 10:20</a>). These blessings are in three stages: (1) in the church, (2) in the millennial kingdom, and (3) in eternity. The blessings in the stage of the church, such as forgiveness, redemption, regeneration, eternal life, the divine nature, etc., are the initial portions. All God&rsquo;s chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life have a share in these initial portions to begin their spiritual life. If they cooperate with God&rsquo;s supplying grace, they will mature in life in the church age, and this earlier maturity in life will constitute a prize with which the Lord will reward them at His coming back. That prize will be the entrance into the millennial kingdom and participation in the divine blessings in that stage, such as the joy and rest of the Lord (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_21>Matt. 25:21</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v25_23>23</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v4_9>Heb. 4:9</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v4_11>11</a>), the reign over the nations (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_26>2:26</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v2_27>27</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>20:4</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>), etc., which God has prepared as an incentive for His chosen ones to go on with Him in the church age. However, many of His chosen ones, after receiving His forgiveness, redemption, eternal life, divine nature, etc., will not cooperate with His grace and will not go on with Him. Hence, they are unable to mature in life in the church age and thus will not be ready at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back to enter into the millennial kingdom and share in the divine blessings of that age as a prize. Therefore, during the millennial kingdom their names will be erased from the book of life. After being disciplined by the Lord and growing in life unto maturity during the millennial kingdom, they will share in the divine blessings in the stage of eternity, such as the eternal priesthood with God&rsquo;s eternal presence, the eternal kingship (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_3>22:3</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>5</a>), the New Jerusalem, the tree of life (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_14>22:14</a>), the water of life (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_17>22:17</a>), etc. At that time their names should again be written in the book of life. This means that all God&rsquo;s chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life and who have been brought into the participation of the divine blessings in the stage of the church &ldquo;shall by no means perish forever&rdquo; (<a href=Joh.htm#v10_28>John 10:28</a>); that is, they shall by no means lose the divine blessings of eternity. But some, those who do not cooperate with the Lord in the church age, will be dispensationally disciplined by the Lord during the millennial kingdom and will miss the divine blessings in that stage."

BD["i*/\x9c"]="<b>tree</b><br> &emsp; In Greek the word for tree here, as in <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_24>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:24</a>, means wood; it is not the word usually used for tree. In the Bible the tree of life always signifies Christ as the embodiment of all the riches of God (<a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>) for our food (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>Gen. 2:9</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v3_22>3:22</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v3_24>24</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_2>Rev. 22:2</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_14>14</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_19>19</a>). Here it signifies the crucified (implied in the tree as a piece of wood&mdash;<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_24>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:24</a>) and resurrected (implied in the life of God&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v11_25>John 11:25</a>) Christ, who today is in the church, the consummation of which will be the New Jerusalem, in which the crucified and resurrected Christ will be the tree of life for the nourishment of all God&rsquo;s redeemed people for eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_2>22:2</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_14>14</a>).<br> &emsp; God&rsquo;s original intention was that man should eat of the tree of life (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>Gen. 2:9</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v2_16>16</a>). Because of the fall, the way to the tree of life was closed to man (<a href=Gen.htm#v3_22>Gen. 3:22</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v3_24>24</a>). Through the redemption of Christ, the way by which man could touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life to man, was opened again (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_19>Heb. 10:19</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_20>20</a>). But in the church&rsquo;s degradation, religion crept in with its knowledge to distract the believers in Christ from eating Him as the tree of life. Hence, the Lord promised to grant the overcomers to eat of Himself as the tree of life in the Paradise of God, as a reward. This is an incentive for them to leave religion with its knowledge and return to the enjoyment of Himself. This promise of the Lord restores the church to God&rsquo;s original intention according to His economy. What the Lord wants the overcomers to do is what the whole church should do in God&rsquo;s economy. Because of the church&rsquo;s degradation, the Lord came to call the overcomers to replace the church in the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s economy.<br> &emsp; The eating of the tree of life not only was God&rsquo;s original intention concerning man but also will be the eternal issue of God&rsquo;s redemption. All God&rsquo;s redeemed people will enjoy the tree of life, which is Christ with all the divine riches as the redeemed&rsquo;s eternal portion for eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_2>Rev. 22:2</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_14>14</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_19>19</a>). Because of religion&rsquo;s distraction and the church&rsquo;s degradation, the Lord in His wisdom made the enjoyment of Himself in the coming kingdom a reward in order to encourage His believers to overcome religion&rsquo;s distracting knowledge in teachings and return to the enjoyment of Himself as the life supply in the church life today for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s economy.<br> &emsp; Eating the tree of life, that is, enjoying Christ as our life supply, should be the primary matter in the church life. The content of the church life depends on the enjoyment of Christ. The more we enjoy Him, the richer the content will be. But to enjoy Christ requires us to love Him with the first love. If we leave our first love toward the Lord, we will miss the enjoyment of Christ and lose the testimony of Jesus; consequently, the lampstand will be removed from us. These three things&mdash;loving the Lord, enjoying the Lord, and being the testimony of the Lord&mdash;go together."
