But according to the divine revelation in the entire New Testament, there is a definite, clear distinction between keeping the law and living by the inner law of life. Keeping the Old Testament law merely makes us right with God and men that we may be justified by the law. But living by the inner law of life (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_10>Heb. 8:10</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v8_11>11</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_2>Rom. 8:2</a>) is to live and magnify Christ (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_20>Phil. 1:20</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>21</a>) for the building up of His Body to express Him (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_22>Eph. 1:22</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>23</a>) and for the building up of God&rsquo;s house to satisfy Him (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>). This is for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal goal according to His New Testament economy. Though we become perfect by keeping the Old Testament law, we still cannot reach God&rsquo;s eternal goal. Only our living by the inner law of life avails for this. Such a living spontaneously and automatically fulfills more than is required under the Old Testament law (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_4>Rom. 8:4</a>), even to the standard of the constitution of the kingdom, as revealed in <a href=Mat.htm#v5>Matt. 5</a>&mdash;<a href=Mat.htm#v7>7</a>."

Suffering responds to Christ&rsquo;s redemption in fulfilling this purpose, preserving us from a sinful manner of life, from the flood of dissoluteness (vv. <a href=1Pe.htm#v4_3>3</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_4>4</a>). Such suffering, mainly from persecution, is God&rsquo;s discipline in His governmental dealing. To undergo such suffering is to be judged, dealt with, and disciplined in the flesh by God (<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_6>v. 6</a>). Hence, we should arm ourselves with a sober mind to endure such suffering."
