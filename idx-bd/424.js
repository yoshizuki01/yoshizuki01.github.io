BD["R9)\x97"]="<b>glorify</b><br> &emsp; This is the subject of the Lord&rsquo;s prayer in this chapter. He was God incarnated in the flesh, and His flesh was a tabernacle in which God could dwell on earth (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>1:14</a>). His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God&rsquo;s shekinah glory had been concealed within the tabernacle. Once, on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory, being seen by the three disciples (<a href=Mat.htm#v17_1>Matt. 17:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v17_4>4</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>). But then it was concealed again in His flesh. Before this prayer He predicted that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_23>12:23</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v13_31>13:31</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v13_32>32</a>). Now He was about to pass through death so that the concealing shell of His humanity might be broken and His divine element, His divine life, might be released. Also, He would resurrect that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed, with the result that His entire being, His divinity and His humanity, would be glorified (see <a href=JohN.htm#n12_23x1>note 23<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Joh.htm#v12>ch. 12</a>). The Father would thus be glorified in Him (see <a href=JohN.htm#n12_28x1>note 28<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Joh.htm#v12>ch. 12</a>). Hence, He prayed for this.<br> &emsp; The Lord&rsquo;s prayer here concerning the divine mystery is fulfilled in three stages. First, it was fulfilled in His resurrection, in that His divine element, His divine life, was released from within His humanity into His many believers (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_23>12:23</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v12_24>24</a>), and His whole being, including His humanity, was brought into glory (<a href=Luk.htm#v24_26>Luke 24:26</a>), and in that the Father&rsquo;s divine element was expressed in His resurrection and glorification. In His resurrection God answered and fulfilled His prayer (<a href=Act.htm#v3_13>Acts 3:13</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v3_15>15</a>). Second, it has been fulfilled in the church, in that as His resurrection life has been expressed through His many members, He has been glorified in them, and the Father has been glorified in Him through the church (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_21>Eph. 3:21</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>-<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_16>16</a>). Third, it will ultimately be fulfilled in the New Jerusalem, in that He will be fully expressed in glory, and God will be glorified in Him through the holy city for eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_11>Rev. 21:11</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_23>23</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_24>24</a>).<br> &emsp; In praying in this way, the Lord unveiled His person, His deity; He is the same as the Father in the divine glory."

Whether we do good or evil, in Adam we have been constituted sinners. This is due to our inward element, not our outward actions.<br> &emsp; In contrast, Christ constitutes us righteous.

God&rsquo;s building is not an ordinary building; it is the sanctuary of the holy God, the temple in which the Spirit of God dwells.

BD["T01\x9a"]="<b>Spirit</b><br> &emsp; The Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ are not two Spirits but one. Paul used these titles interchangeably, indicating that the indwelling Spirit of life in <a href=Rom.htm#v8_2>v. 2</a> is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the entire Triune God. God, the Spirit, and Christ&mdash;the three of the Godhead&mdash;are all mentioned in this verse. However, there are not three in us; there is only one, the triune Spirit of the Triune God (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_24>John 4:24</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:17</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_11>Rom. 8:11</a>). The Spirit of God implies that this Spirit is of the One who was from eternity past, who created the universe and is the origin of all things. The Spirit of Christ implies that this Spirit is the embodiment and reality of Christ, the incarnated One. This Christ accomplished everything necessary to fulfill God&rsquo;s plan. He includes not only divinity, which He possessed from eternity, but also humanity, which He obtained through incarnation. He also includes human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. This is the Spirit of Christ in resurrection, that is, Christ Himself dwelling in our spirit (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_10>v. 10</a>) to impart Himself, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, into us as resurrection life and power to deal with the death that is in our nature (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_2>v. 2</a>). Thus, we may live today in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, in Christ Himself, by living in the mingled spirit."
