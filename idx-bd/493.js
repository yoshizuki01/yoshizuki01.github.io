The order of Aaron was for the priesthood that was only in humanity, whereas the order of Melchizedek is for the priesthood that is in both humanity and divinity.

BD["<+4\x97"]="<b>rejoice</b><br> &emsp; In all his experiments in human life Solomon encouraged the fallen men under the sun, in accordance with God&rsquo;s economy, to rejoice and do good in their lifetime and to enjoy what God has given to them, eating, drinking, and tasting enjoyment in all their labor (<a href=Ecc.htm#v2_24>2:24</a>; <a href=Ecc.htm#v3_12>3:12</a>-<a href=Ecc.htm#v3_13>13</a>; <a href=Ecc.htm#v5_18>5:18</a>-<a href=Ecc.htm#v5_20>20</a>; <a href=Ecc.htm#v8_15>8:15</a>; <a href=Ecc.htm#v9_7>9:7</a>-<a href=Ecc.htm#v9_10>10</a>). God created man for Himself, but man was seduced by Satan to give God up, and thus man became fallen. Nevertheless, God still blesses man so that he may have a good living and enjoy various material things (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v5_45>Matt. 5:45b</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v6_17>1&nbsp;Tim. 6:17</a>). By so doing God maintains the existence of the human race from generation to generation, thus affording Himself the opportunity to accomplish His redemption for fallen man, to carry out His eternal purpose in His choosing and predestinating men for the Body of Christ, and to maintain the fallen man of His old creation to be the provision for Him to bring in His new creation in Christ out of the old creation (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:17</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v6_15>Gal. 6:15</a>). This is proved by the apostle Paul&rsquo;s preaching in <a href=Act.htm#v14_15>Acts 14:15</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v14_17>17</a> and <a href=Act.htm#v17_24>17:24</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v17_31>31</a>.<br> &emsp; To live a life that we may testify Christ and minister Christ to others to glorify God, we need the material things and physical matters. But we should not be attracted, captured, and usurped by them. If we are usurped by them, we will suffer their vanity. We are living in the world and passing through the &ldquo;vanity fair,&rdquo; but we should not linger in it for its vainglory (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_15>1&nbsp;John 2:15</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_17>17</a>). Today all things of the old creation are under the slavery of corruption (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_20>Rom. 8:20</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_21>21</a>). If we do not escape &ldquo;the corruption which is in the world by lust&rdquo; (<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_4>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:4</a>), we will share in its vanity."

This figure may also signify our being revived every morning. The Christian life is like the dawning of the sun (<a href=Jdg.htm#v5_31>Judg. 5:31</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v13_43>Matt. 13:43</a>).
