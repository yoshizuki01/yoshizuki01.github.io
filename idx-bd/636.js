BD["I)*)o1"]="<b>II.</b>&nbsp; Jehovah as the majestic Judge"
BD["b+/\x97"]="<b>nature</b><br> &emsp; The natures of beasts on the land, birds in the air, reptiles in the dust, and creatures in the water have been tamed by the nature of man, which is stronger than all the animal natures. However, even the stronger human nature is not able to tame the tongue."
BD["U,6)o18"]="<b>4.</b>&nbsp; The begetting father"
BD["a/,\x97"]="<b>great</b><br> &emsp; The fact that Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils testifies to the greatness of Melchizedek, who is a type of Christ. Christ, as a Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, is greater than the priests of the tribe of Levi, who offered tithes to Melchizedek through their father Abraham (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_9>v. 9</a>), since they were in Abraham&rsquo;s loins when he met Melchizedek (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_10>v. 10</a>)."
BD["E)))o0"]="<b>I.</b>&nbsp; The introductory word"
BD["b*2\x97"]="<b>keeps</b><br> &emsp; The word in vv. <a href=Jam.htm#v2_8>8</a>-<a href=Jam.htm#v2_11>11</a> indicates that the Jewish believers at James&rsquo;s time were still practicing the keeping of the Old Testament law. This corresponds with the word in <a href=Act.htm#v21_20>Acts 21:20</a> spoken to Paul by James and the elders in Jerusalem. James, the elders in Jerusalem, and many thousands of Jewish believers were still in a mixture of the Christian faith and the Mosaic law. They even advised Paul to practice such a semi-Judaic mixture (<a href=Act.htm#v21_17>Acts 21:17</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v21_26>26</a>). They were unaware that the dispensation of law was altogether over and that the dispensation of grace should be fully honored, and that any disregard of the distinction between these two dispensations would be against God&rsquo;s dispensational administration and would be a great damage to God&rsquo;s economical plan for the building up of the church as the expression of Christ. Thus, this Epistle was written under the cloud of a semi-Judaic mixture, under a background that was obscured. Many who practice religion according to their natural concept neglect the background seen in this book."
BD["a./\x97"]="<b>rain</b><br> &emsp; The rain here refers back to the five categories of good things mentioned in vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v6_4>4</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v6_5>5</a>."
BD["b)5\x97"]="<b>tempted</b><br> &emsp; Or, tried, tested. The Greek word for trials and trial in vv. <a href=Jam.htm#v1_2>2</a> and <a href=Jam.htm#v1_12>12</a> is the noun form of the word for tempted here and in <a href=Jam.htm#v1_14>v. 14</a>. The two words are very similar in form; both refer to being tried, tested, proved. To be tried, tested, proved, by outward suffering in the environment is a trial (<a href=Jam.htm#v1_2>v. 2</a>). To be tried, tested, proved, by the inward enticing of lust is a temptation (<a href=Jam.htm#v1_14>v. 14</a>). The trial is dealt with in vv. <a href=Jam.htm#v1_2>2</a>-<a href=Jam.htm#v1_12>12</a>; the temptation is dealt with in vv. <a href=Jam.htm#v1_13>13</a>-<a href=Jam.htm#v1_21>21</a>. As for the trial, we should endure it by loving the Lord that we may obtain the blessing&mdash;the crown of life. As for the temptation, we should resist it by receiving the implanted word that we may obtain salvation&mdash;the salvation of our souls (<a href=Jam.htm#v1_21>v. 21</a>)."
BD["b)4\x9a"]="<b>life</b><br> &emsp; The crown of life in this verse, the begetting Father and His begetting us, His making us the firstfruits of His creatures (vv. <a href=Jam.htm#v1_17>17</a>-<a href=Jam.htm#v1_18>18</a>, <a href=Jam.htm#v1_27>27</a>), and the implanted word (<a href=Jam.htm#v1_21>v. 21</a>), all point to the believers&rsquo; need for the divine life."

BD["a+8\x97"]="<b>Moses</b><br> &emsp; Moses brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, but he did not bring them into the good land of Canaan. It was his successor, Joshua, who did this (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_8>4:8</a>)."

BD["c*)\x97"]="<b>Therefore</b><br> &emsp; The exhortation in vv. <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_1>1</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_10>10</a> is based on what is unveiled in <a href=1Pe.htm#v1>ch. 1</a>. Three main things accomplished in the believers by the Triune God are stressed in <a href=1Pe.htm#v1>ch. 1</a>: the Father&rsquo;s regeneration (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_3>1:3</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_23>23</a>), the Son&rsquo;s redemption (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_2>1:2</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_18>18</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_19>19</a>), and the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_2>1:2</a>). These make the believers a holy people, who live a holy life (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_15>1:15</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_16>16</a>). Based on this, Peter charged the believers to grow in life (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_2>v. 2</a>) for the building up of a spiritual house (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>v. 5</a>)."
BD["c),\x97"]="<b>Unto</b><br> &emsp; Unto an inheritance here is in apposition to unto a living hope in <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_3>v. 3</a>. The living hope, resulting from regeneration, is our expectation of the coming blessing; the inheritance is the fulfillment of our hope in the coming age and in eternity."
BD["c)+\x9a"]="<b>regenerated</b><br> &emsp; Regeneration, like redemption and justification, is an aspect of God&rsquo;s full salvation. Redemption and justification solve our problem with God and reconcile us to God; regeneration enlivens us with God&rsquo;s life, bringing us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God. Hence, regeneration issues and results in a living hope. Such regeneration is accomplished through the resurrection of Christ from the dead. &ldquo;The resurrection of Christ, bringing in life and the gift of the life-giving Spirit, is that which potentiates the new birth unto a living hope&rdquo; (Alford)."
BD["c)*\x9d"]="<b>obedience</b><br> &emsp; The New Testament dispensation has the blood of Jesus Christ. That blood is in contrast to the blood of animals, which the Old Testament dispensation had. The Jewish believers were familiar with the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of animals under the Old Testament dispensation, but now they had to realize that the dispensation had been changed and that under the New Testament dispensation the law of Moses and the blood of animals had been replaced by the person of Christ and the blood of Christ. The result of such a realization is that the believers obey Jesus Christ and are sprinkled by His blood."

See notes <a href=JamN.htm#n1_1x3>1<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Jam.htm#v1>ch. 1</a> and <a href=JamN.htm#n2_2x1>2<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Jam.htm#v2>ch. 2</a>."
