After the experiences of so many called ones, this book concludes with a life that, in Jacob on the one hand, expressed God in His image and, in Joseph on the other hand, represented God with His dominion (see <a href=GenN.htm#n37_1x1P2>note 1<sup>1</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=Gen.htm#v37>ch. 37</a>). How excellent and wonderful this is! However, what is portrayed in Genesis is still a shadow in the age of typology. At Joseph&rsquo;s time the reality had not come. Hence, in the conclusion of this book Joseph died expecting the age of fulfillment, in which he would share in the reality."
