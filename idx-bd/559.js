In such expressions, day is used mainly in the sense of judgment for governmental dealing. Before the Lord comes, it is &ldquo;man&rsquo;s day,&rdquo; in which man judges until the Lord comes (<a href=1Co.htm#v4_3>1&nbsp;Cor. 4:3</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v4_5>5</a>). Then, it will be &ldquo;the day of the Lord,&rdquo; which will begin with the Lord&rsquo;s parousia (presence&mdash;<a href=Mat.htm#v24_3>Matt. 24:3</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n24_3x3>note 3</a>) with all its judgments and will end with the judgment upon men and the demons at the great white throne (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_11>Rev. 20:11</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_15>15</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n20_11x1>notes</a>). The Lord&rsquo;s parousia (presence) will begin when the overcoming saints are raptured to the throne of God in the heavens before the great tribulation of three and a half years (<a href=Rev.htm#v12_5>Rev. 12:5</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v12_6>6</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v14_1>14:1</a>). Then, all the supernatural calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets will be meted out to smite the earth with the things on it and the heavens with their heavenly bodies (<a href=Rev.htm#v6_12>Rev. 6:12</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v6_17>17</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v8_7>8:7</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v8_12>12</a>). This will be the beginning of the great tribulation. The great tribulation, which will consist mainly of the woes of the last three trumpets, including the plagues of the seven bowls, will last for three and a half years (<a href=Mat.htm#v24_21>Matt. 24:21</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v24_22>22</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v24_29>29</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v8_13>Rev. 8:13</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v9_21>9:21</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v11_14>11:14</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v15_5>15:5</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v16_21>16:21</a>). That will be a time of trial for the inhabitants of the whole earth (<a href=Rev.htm#v3_10>Rev. 3:10</a>), including the Jews (<a href=Isa.htm#v2_12>Isa. 2:12</a>; <a href=Zec.htm#v14_1>Zech. 14:1</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v14_2>2</a>; <a href=Mal.htm#v4_1>Mal. 4:1</a>, <a href=Mal.htm#v4_5>5</a>; <a href=Joe.htm#v1_15>Joel 1:15</a>-<a href=Joe.htm#v1_20>20</a>; <a href=Joe.htm#v2_1>2:1</a>, <a href=Joe.htm#v2_11>11</a>, <a href=Joe.htm#v2_31>31</a>) and the believers in Christ who are left in the tribulation (<a href=Rev.htm#v12_17>Rev. 12:17</a>). At the end of the great tribulation, Christ&rsquo;s parousia (presence), with the overcomers, will come to the air (<a href=Rev.htm#v10_1>Rev. 10:1</a>), and the dead saints will be resurrected and raptured together with the majority of the living believers, who will have passed through the great tribulation, to meet with the Lord in the air (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_52>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:52</a>; <a href=1Th.htm#v4_16>1&nbsp;Thes. 4:16</a>-<a href=1Th.htm#v4_17>17</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v14_14>Rev. 14:14</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v14_16>16</a>). After this, all the believers will be judged by the Lord at His judgment seat in the air (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_10>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:10</a>). Then the Lord will have His wedding feast with the overcoming saints (<a href=Rev.htm#v19_7>Rev. 19:7</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v19_8>8</a>). Immediately after this, the Lord with His bride, composed of the overcoming saints as His army, will come to the earth (<a href=Zec.htm#v14_4>Zech. 14:4</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v14_5>5</a>; <a href=Jud.htm#v14>Jude 14</a>; <a href=1Th.htm#v3_13>1&nbsp;Thes. 3:13</a>) to fight and defeat Antichrist and his army; they will seize Antichrist and his false prophet and cast them alive into the lake of fire (<a href=Rev.htm#v19_11>Rev. 19:11</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v19_21>21</a>). At approximately that time, Babylon the Great will be destroyed (<a href=Rev.htm#v17_1>Rev. 17:1</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v19_3>19:3</a>). At the same time, the Lord will deliver, gather, and restore the children of Israel (<a href=Zec.htm#v12_2>Zech. 12:2</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v12_14>14</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v11_26>Rom. 11:26</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v24_31>Matt. 24:31</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v1_6>Acts 1:6</a>). Following this, Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss, the bottomless pit (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_1>Rev. 20:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_3>3</a>). Then the Lord will judge the nations (the living&mdash;<a href=Mat.htm#v25_31>Matt. 25:31</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v25_46>46</a>; <a href=Joe.htm#v3_2>Joel 3:2</a>). After this, the millennial kingdom will come (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>Rev. 20:4</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>). After the thousand years, Satan will be loosed from the abyss and will instigate certain of the nations, Gog and Magog in the north of the eastern hemisphere, to carry out the last rebellion against God. They will be subdued and burned, and the deceiving devil will be cast into the lake of fire (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_7>Rev. 20:7</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_10>10</a>). Following this, the heavens and the earth will be fully cleared up by being burned up (vv. <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_7>7</a>, <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_10>10</a>). Then will come the final judgment upon men (the dead) and the demons, and probably also upon the fallen angels (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_4>2:4</a> and <a href=2PeN.htm#n2_4x4>note 4</a>), at the great white throne (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_11>Rev. 20:11</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_15>15</a>). That will be God&rsquo;s consummate dealing with His old creation in His universal government and will be in addition to so many judgments and dealings executed within the day of the Lord to clear up the old universe. Then a new universe will begin with the new heaven and new earth for eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_1>Rev. 21:1</a>), in which there will be no more judgment related to God&rsquo;s governmental dealing, for no unighteousness will dwell there. Therefore, not counting the one thousand years, the day of the Lord will be very short, probably not more than seven years. This will be the main part of the last week (seven years) of the seventy weeks in <a href=Dan.htm#v9_24>Dan. 9:24</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v9_27>27</a>. It is unscriptural to consider the day of God and the day of the Lord two different days: the day of the Lord ends with the millennial kingdom, and the day of God begins with the burning of the heavens and the earth, followed by the judgment of the great white throne. Actually, since the judgment of the great white throne will be executed by the Lord Jesus (<a href=Act.htm#v10_42>Acts 10:42</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v17_31>17:31</a>; <a href=2Ti.htm#v4_1>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:1</a>), it too will be in the day of the Lord. God does not judge anyone; He has given all judgment to the Lord (<a href=Joh.htm#v5_22>John 5:22</a>)."
