Regeneration is the entrance to the kingdom (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_5>John 3:5</a>), and the growth of the divine life within the believers is the kingdom&rsquo;s development (<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_3>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:3</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_11>11</a>).

BD[":q9\x97"]="<b>sanctuary</b><br> &emsp; The solution to the psalmist&rsquo;s perplexity concerning the prosperity of the wicked was obtained in God&rsquo;s sanctuary.

Thus, to go into the sanctuary of God, we need to turn to our spirit and go to the meetings of the church. Once we are in the sanctuary&mdash;in the spirit and in the church&mdash;we will have another view, a particular perception, of the situation concerning the wicked (vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v73_18>18</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v73_20>20</a>).

In the old dispensation the law concerning divorce was ordained because of the people&rsquo;s hardness of heart; that law was not according to God&rsquo;s design in the beginning (<a href=Mat.htm#v19_7>19:7</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v19_8>8</a>).
