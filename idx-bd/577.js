At the time of delivery Zarah put out his hand, and the midwife marked it with a scarlet thread, indicating that he would be the firstborn. However, Pharez preceded him to be the firstborn (<a href=Gen.htm#v38_27>Gen. 38:27</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v38_30>30</a>). Pharez was not chosen by man but was sent by God, proving that it was not by man&rsquo;s choice but by God&rsquo;s."

This indicates that Zerubbabel himself is not the source. He is not a tree complete in himself; rather, he is a tree that is actually a branch of another tree, and that tree is the source. Moreover, Zerubbabel is also a shoot from the other tree, which tree is Christ. Christ is the unique olive tree (<a href=Rom.htm#v11_17>Rom. 11:17</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n11_17x2>note 2</a>), and Zerubbabel and all Christ&rsquo;s believers are branches, shoots, of Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v15_5>John 15:5a</a>). Thus, all the believers are the many olive trees, not in the sense of being separate trees but in the sense of being branches of Christ, the unique olive tree."
