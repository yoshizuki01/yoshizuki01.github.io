After the baptism by John, the preaching of the gospel of peace began (<a href=Act.htm#v10_36>Acts 10:36</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v10_37>37</a>).

Both the priests and the scribes had knowledge concerning the birth of Christ (vv. <a href=Mat.htm#v2_5>5</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v2_6>6</a>), but, unlike the magi from the east, they did not see the vision, nor did they have the heart to seek after Christ."

Of the twelve tribes, one was kept for David&rsquo;s sake (<a href=1Ki.htm#v11_13>1&nbsp;Kings 11:13</a>), that is, for Christ. Christ needed the kingdom that belonged to the house of David, because He had to be born as an heir to David&rsquo;s throne.<br> &emsp; After being divided, the kingdom of David was in two parts. The northern part was called the kingdom of Israel (a universal name) and was composed of ten tribes of Israel; the southern part was called the kingdom of Judah (a local name) and was composed of two tribes, Judah and Benjamin. Although the kingdom of Israel was more universal than that of Judah, not one of the names of the kings of Israel was included in the genealogy of Christ. The kings of Israel were excluded because they were not associated with Christ. They were for something other than Christ."

Hence, she was remarried as a result of murder and adultery (<a href=2Sa.htm#v11_26>2&nbsp;Sam. 11:26</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v11_27>27</a>). David, a man after the heart of God, did right in the eyes of the Lord all the days of his life, except for this one evil (<a href=1Ki.htm#v15_5>1&nbsp;Kings 15:5</a>). This genealogy does not say &ldquo;of Bathsheba&rdquo; but &ldquo;of her who had been the wife of Uriah,&rdquo; to emphasize this great sin of David&rsquo;s, thus showing that Christ as the kingly Savior is related not only to the heathen but also to sinners."
