BD[":>(\x8d"]="<b>hind</b><br> &emsp; Perhaps a reference to a melody common at that time. The hind of the dawn here signifies Christ in His resurrection, which took place at early dawn (<a href=Luk.htm#v24_1>Luke 24:1</a>). A hind is a deer known for its leaping and jumping. Christ in resurrection is the leaping One (<a href=SoS.htm#v2_8>S.S. 2:8</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v2_9>9</a>)."
BD["e*+\x97"]="<b>And</b><br> &emsp; Verses <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_1>1</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_2>2</a> are a conclusion to the word in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_5>1:5</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_10>10</a> regarding our confessing and God&rsquo;s forgiving of our sins, which interrupt our fellowship with Him. That is the first condition of&mdash;the first requirement for&mdash;our enjoyment of the fellowship of the divine life. Verses <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_3>3</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_11>11</a> deal with the second condition of&mdash;the second requirement for&mdash;our fellowship with God: that we keep the Lord&rsquo;s word and love the brothers."
BD["c)\@\x97"]="<b>flesh</b><br> &emsp; Referring to fallen man. The entire fallen human race is like withering grass, and its glory like the falling flower of grass. The believers were once like that, but the living and abiding word of the Lord, as the seed sown into them through regeneration, has changed their nature, making them living and abiding forever."
BD["e*)\x9d"]="<b>Father</b><br> &emsp; Here this divine title indicates that our case, which the Lord Jesus as our Advocate undertakes for us, is a family affair, a case between children and the Father. Through regeneration we have been born children of God. After regeneration, if we sin, it is a matter of children sinning against their Father. Our Advocate, who is the sacrifice for our propitiation, undertakes for us to restore our interrupted fellowship with the Father that we may abide in the enjoyment of the divine fellowship."

The divine light is the divine life in the Son operating in us. This light shines in the darkness within us, and the darkness cannot overcome it (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_4>John 1:4</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_5>5</a>). When we follow this light, we shall by no means walk in darkness (<a href=Joh.htm#v8_12>John 8:12</a>), which, according to the context, is the darkness of sin (vv. <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_7>7</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_10>10</a>)."

Christ died for our sins, bearing up our sins on the cross, that our sins might be forgiven by God. But He was made sin and took away the sin of the world that the problem of our sin might be solved. Peter did not deal first with sin in our nature but with sins in our conduct, in our manner of life (<a href=1Pe.htm#v3_16>v. 16</a>).
