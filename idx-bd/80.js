BD["W.9)o19"]="<b>I.</b>&nbsp; Bearing the brands of Jesus"
BD["A5/\x8c"]="Have you not seen a vain vision and spoken deceptive divination when you say, Jehovah declares! and I have not spoken?"
BD["A42\x8c"]="Say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, This burden pertains to the prince in Jerusalem and to all the house of Israel, which is in it."
BD["V)+)o3"]="<b>1.</b>&nbsp; Comforted to comfort"
BD["A35\x8c"]="And when I prophesied, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died; and I fell on my face and cried out with a loud voice, and I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Are You making a full end to the remnant of Israel?"
BD["A28\x8c"]="And whenever the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and whenever the cherubim lifted their wings to rise up from the earth, the wheels also did not turn from beside them."
BD["\@+V\x8c"]="All our enemies have opened / Their mouths against us."
BD["A/A\x8c"]="Anguish comes; and they seek peace, but there is none."
BD["B4)\x8c"]="And at that time Michael, the great prince who stands for the children of your people, will arise; and there will be a time of distress, such as never occurred since there came to be a nation until that time; and at that time your people, every one found written in the book, will be delivered."
BD["B3,\x8c"]="But once he arises, his kingdom will be broken and divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom will be plucked up and given to others besides his descendants."

BD["B05\x8c"]="Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to the particular one who was speaking, How long will the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression that desolates apply, so that the sanctuary and the host are trampled down?"
BD["9O)\x8c"]="Do you know the time when the mountain goats bring forth? / Can you mark the time when the hinds calve?"
BD["h)=\x99"]="<b>Lord</b><br> &emsp; The entire Blessed Trinity is employed and enjoyed by the believers in their praying in the Holy Spirit, keeping themselves in the love of God, and awaiting the mercy of our Lord unto eternal life."
BD["B/8\x8c"]="I came near to one of those standing by and asked of him the exact meaning of all this. So he told me and made the interpretation of the things known to me:"
BD["9N,\x8c"]="Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? / Tell Me, if you have understanding."
BD["B.;\x8c"]="Then the king arose at dawn at the first light, and went in haste to the lions&rsquo; den."

BD["i,+\x99"]="<b>rainbow</b><br> &emsp; The rainbow is a sign of God&rsquo;s covenant with man and all living creatures that He will not destroy them again with a flood (<a href=Gen.htm#v9_8>Gen. 9:8</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v9_17>17</a>). This book shows that God will judge the earth with all its inhabitants. The rainbow around His throne signifies that God is the covenanting God, the faithful God, who will keep His covenant while executing His judgment upon the earth. He will not judge mankind again with a flood nor destroy all mankind, but will keep a part of mankind to be the nations on the new earth for His glory (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_24>21:24</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_26>26</a>)."
BD["9L2\x8c"]="He also opens their ear to instruction / And commands that they return from iniquity."

BD["9K5\x8c"]="Surely God does not hear an empty cry, / And the Almighty does not regard it."
BD[">>/\x8c"]="Then your choicest valleys / Were full of chariots, / And the horsemen firmly fixed themselves at the gate;"
BD["C1)\x8c"]="Do not rejoice, O Israel, / To exult like the nations. / For you have gone as a harlot away from your God; / You have loved payment / Upon every grain floor."
BD["B+D\x8c"]="Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him and changed the king&rsquo;s word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God."
BD["i*1\x99"]="<b>slander</b><br> &emsp; The Judaizers slandered the suffering church by evilly criticizing her. They stubbornly insisted on keeping their Judaistic system, consisting of the Levitical priesthood, the sacrificial rituals, and the material temple, which were all types that had been fulfilled and replaced by Christ. Since the church under the new covenant in God&rsquo;s economy had no part in their religious practice, the Judaizers slanderously criticized her. In principle, it is the same today, in that religious people slander the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, which seek the Lord and follow Him in spirit and in life and do not care for any religious system or practice."
BD[">=2\x8c"]="My threshed ones, / And the son of the threshing floor! / What I have heard / From Jehovah of hosts, / The God of Israel, / I have declared to you."

BD["C0,\x8c"]="They have set up kings, but not by Me; / They have set up princes, but I did not acknowledge it. / With their silver and their gold they made / Idols for themselves, / That they might be cut off."
BD["B*G\x8c"]="You, O king, were watching, and there was a single great image. This image, large and its brightness surpassing, stood opposite you; and its appearance was frightful."
BD["i)4\x99"]="<b>lampstands</b><br> &emsp; In the Bible the lampstand is always related to God&rsquo;s building. The first time the lampstand was mentioned was in <a href=Exo.htm#v25_31>Exo. 25:31</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v25_40>40</a>, when the tabernacle was built. The second instance was in regard to the building of the temple in <a href=1Ki.htm#v7_49>1&nbsp;Kings 7:49</a>. The third instance was closely related to the rebuilding of God&rsquo;s temple in <a href=Zec.htm#v4_2>Zech. 4:2</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v4_10>10</a>. Here in Revelation the lampstand is related to the building of the churches. In <a href=Exo.htm#v25>Exo. 25</a> the emphasis is on Christ being the lampstand as the divine light, shining as seven lamps with the Spirit (the oil). In <a href=Zec.htm#v4>Zech. 4</a> the emphasis is on the Spirit (<a href=Zec.htm#v4_6>Zech. 4:6</a>) as seven lamps shining, these seven lamps being the seven eyes of God (<a href=Zec.htm#v4_2>Zech. 4:2</a>, <a href=Zec.htm#v4_10>10</a>). The seven eyes of God are the seven Spirits of God (<a href=Rev.htm#v5_6>Rev. 5:6</a>) for God&rsquo;s intensified move. This indicates that the lampstand in Zechariah is the reality of the lampstand in Exodus, and that the lampstands in Revelation are the reproduction of the lampstand in Zechariah. Christ is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is expressed as the churches. The shining Spirit is the reality of the shining Christ, and the shining churches are the reproduction and expression of the shining Spirit to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose that the New Jerusalem as the shining city may be consummated. Christ, the Spirit, and the churches are all of the same divine nature."
