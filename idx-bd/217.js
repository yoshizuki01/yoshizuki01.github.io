The redeeming of the land by the person who sold it, he not having anyone to redeem it for him (vv. <a href=Lev.htm#v25_26>26</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v25_27>27</a>), signifies that the children of Israel, not recognizing the Lord Jesus as their nearest relative (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_11>John 1:11</a>), have put themselves in the position of having to bear the responsibility for their redemption until they become able to redeem themselves. However, to this day they are still unable to do it, and actually they will never be able to do it. When the Lord Jesus comes back, they will recognize Him as their relative (<a href=Zec.htm#v12_10>Zech. 12:10</a>), and then they will be redeemed by Him. Not having sufficient means to redeem the possession and waiting for the year of jubilee, when the one who sold the land would return to his possession (<a href=Lev.htm#v25_28>v. 28</a>), signifies that we were unable to redeem what we had lost until the coming of the New Testament jubilee, in which all that we had lost is released to us to be our possession.

The shining of the lampstand signifies the blossoming, the expression, of the divine life in resurrection. To have the blossoming of the resurrection life for the shining of the divine light, the believers in Christ, who have received the divine life with the divine nature through regeneration (<a href=Col.htm#v3_4>Col. 3:4</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v1_4>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:4</a>), need to live Christ, to live divinity, by practicing to be one spirit with the Lord (<a href=1Co.htm#v6_17>1&nbsp;Cor. 6:17</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>Phil. 1:21a</a>)."

BD["V3+\x98"]="<b>simplicity</b><br> &emsp; Or, singleness. Referring to the believers&rsquo; single-hearted loyalty, single-minded faithfulness, toward Christ. In the garden of Eden, Eve, the wife of Adam, was deceived by the serpent, Satan, through his questioning and undermining of God&rsquo;s word, and was thus carried away to the tree of knowledge and distracted from the simplicity of eating the tree of life (<a href=Gen.htm#v3_1>Gen. 3:1</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v3_6>6</a>). Here the church in Corinth, the pure virgin betrothed to Christ, was being deceived by the Judaizers, the ministers of Satan (<a href=2Co.htm#v11_15>v. 15</a>), who were undermining God&rsquo;s word by preaching another Jesus, a different spirit, and a different gospel (<a href=2Co.htm#v11_4>v. 4</a>). Because of this undermining preaching, the apostle was fearful that the Corinthians would be distracted by the teachings of the Judaizers and would be separated from the genuine appreciation, love, and enjoyment of the precious person of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself as their life and their everything. The above-mentioned three things preached by the Judaizers, who intermingled with the believers, were of Satan."

BD["V.:\x98"]="<b>sons</b><br> &emsp; This is the only instance in which the New Testament indicates that God has daughters. For the most part it tells us that the believers are sons of God."
BD["V-=\x98"]="<b>sin</b><br> &emsp; Sin came from Satan, who rebelled against God (<a href=Isa.htm#v14_12>Isa. 14:12</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v14_14>14</a>). This sin, which came out of the evil one, entered into man (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_12>Rom. 5:12</a>) and made man not only a sinner but sin itself under God&rsquo;s judgment. Hence, when Christ became a man in the flesh (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>), He was made sin (not sinful) on our behalf to be judged by God (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_3>Rom. 8:3</a>) that we might become God&rsquo;s righteousness in Him."

BD["+?=\x97"]="<b>iniquity</b><br> &emsp; This word was spoken not according to the human view but according to the divine view. In the sight of God, Israel is without fault. In themselves God&rsquo;s people have many defects, but in God&rsquo;s redemption and in Christ they have no defects. When God looks at His people, He does not see them according to what they are in themselves but according to what they are in Christ (cf. <a href=2Co.htm#v5_16>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:16</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v5_17>17</a>)."
