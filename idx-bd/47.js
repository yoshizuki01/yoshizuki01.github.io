BD["0,+\x97"]="<b>Ark</b><br> &emsp; In their degradation Israel was foolish because they did not trust in God directly. Rather, they trusted in the systems ordained by God. In their situation they should have repented, made a thorough confession, and returned to God from their idols, and they should have inquired of God as to what He wanted them to do. Instead, having no heart for God&rsquo;s desire or for His eternal economy, they exercised their superstition to trust in the Ark based on the past victories they had experienced through the move of the Ark (<a href=Num.htm#v10_35>Num. 10:35</a>; <a href=Jos.htm#v6>Josh. 6</a>). But this time their situation was not right. In their degradation they offended God to the uttermost, and God left them. Eventually, instead of the Ark saving Israel, the Ark itself was captured (<a href=1Sa.htm#v4_11>v. 11a</a>).<br> &emsp; The Ark typifies Christ as the embodiment of God (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n25_10x1>note 10<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v25>Exo. 25</a>). It also signifies Christ as the presence of the Triune God with His people for the carrying out of His economy to establish His kingdom on earth. To bring out the Ark was to bring out the presence of God (<a href=1Sa.htm#v4_4>v. 4</a>). The move of the Ark was a picture of God&rsquo;s move on the earth in Christ as His embodiment (<a href=Num.htm#v10_33>Num. 10:33</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v10_36>36</a>; see <a href=PsaN.htm#n68_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Psa.htm#v68>Psa. 68</a>). During Israel&rsquo;s fighting with the Philistines, God did not intend to move. The children of Israel had no thought of or concern for God&rsquo;s economy, and their bringing out the Ark indicated that they were usurping God, even forcing Him to go out with them for their safety, peace, rest, and profit. In principle, we do the same thing whenever we pray for our prosperity without any consideration of God&rsquo;s economy. Instead of usurping God, we should pray, live, and be persons according to God&rsquo;s heart and for His economy."
