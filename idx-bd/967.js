The scribes considered this to be against the theology of their religion (vv. <a href=Mrk.htm#v2_1>1</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v2_12>12</a>).<br> &emsp; (2) As a Physician to the sick and miserable people, He feasted with the tax collectors, who were disloyal and unfaithful to their race, and with sinners, who were despised and isolated from society, that they might taste the mercy of God and be recovered to the enjoyment of God. This was condemned by the self-righteous yet merciless scribes of the Pharisees (vv. <a href=Mrk.htm#v2_13>13</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v2_17>17</a>).<br> &emsp; (3) As a Bridegroom with the sons of the bridechamber, He caused His followers to be merry and happy without fasting. Thus He annulled the practice of the disciples of John (the new religionists) and the Pharisees (the old religionists) so that His followers could be delivered from the practices of their religion into the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s Christ as their Bridegroom, with His righteousness as their outer clothing and His life as their inner wine in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (vv. <a href=Mrk.htm#v2_18>18</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v2_22>22</a>).<br> &emsp; (4) He allowed His followers to pick the ears of grain in the grainfields on the Sabbath so that they could satisfy their hunger. Thus, apparently they broke God&rsquo;s commandment concerning the Sabbath, but actually they pleased God because the hunger of Christ&rsquo;s followers was satisfied through Him, as the hunger of David and his followers had been satisfied with the bread of the Presence in the house of God. This indicates that in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, it is a matter not of keeping the regulation of religion but of enjoying satisfaction in and through Christ as the real Sabbath rest (vv. <a href=Mrk.htm#v2_23>23</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v2_28>28</a>).<br> &emsp; (5) On the Sabbath He healed a man who had a withered hand, caring not for the keeping of the Sabbath but for the health of His sheep. Thus He indicated that in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy it is a matter not of keeping regulations but of imparting life. For this He was hated by the Pharisees, the religionists (<a href=Mrk.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v3_6>6</a>).<br> &emsp; All five merciful and living ways taken by the Slave-Savior to carry out His gospel service contradicted the formal and traditional religion and were therefore abhorred by the fleshly, stubborn, and lifeless religious leaders."

It is written in poetry, with types and signs, portraying the steps in God&rsquo;s move on the earth in Christ. The Ark (typifying Christ&mdash;<a href=Exo.htm#v25_10>Exo. 25:10</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v25_22>22</a> and <a href=ExoN.htm#n25_10x1>notes</a>) was the center of the tabernacle (also typifying Christ&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>). God&rsquo;s move in the tabernacle with the Ark among Israel, His elect, from Sinai to Zion typifies the Triune God&rsquo;s move in Christ as His all-inclusive embodiment from Christ&rsquo;s incarnation to His ascension. In the type, God&rsquo;s move was from Sinai (vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v68_8>8b</a>, <a href=Psa.htm#v68_17>17b</a>), beginning with the decreeing of the law and the erecting of the tabernacle, which signifies the incarnated Christ, through the wilderness (vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v68_4>4b</a>, <a href=Psa.htm#v68_7>7b</a>), which signifies the earth, to Mount Zion (<a href=Psa.htm#v68_16>v. 16</a>), God&rsquo;s dwelling place, which signifies God&rsquo;s dwelling place in the heavens (<a href=Rev.htm#v14_1>Rev. 14:1</a>). In the reality, God&rsquo;s move in Christ and through Christ for the accomplishing of His New Testament economy began with Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, which was the setting up of the real and living tabernacle in whom God dwelt and through whom He could move on earth; continued through Christ&rsquo;s human living on the earth with His crucifixion and resurrection; and concluded with Christ&rsquo;s ascension to Zion in the heavens. This unique move of God is portrayed in vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v68_1>1</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v68_18>18</a> of this psalm.
