BD["AE=\x97"]="<b>horn</b><br> &emsp; A horn signifies power for fighting unto victory. Christ is the horn that will sprout for the house of Israel. At Ezekiel&rsquo;s time other nations had conquered and oppressed the people of Israel, and Israel had no way to go on. But God promised that one day a horn would sprout forth from the house of Israel to be against all the nations and to overcome the authorities on earth so that the nation of Israel may be saved. Christ will become the horn to deliver them from all oppression and bondage (<a href=Jer.htm#v23_5>Jer. 23:5</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v23_6>6</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v1_69>Luke 1:69</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v1_71>71</a>; cf. <a href=Zec.htm#v12_2>Zech. 12:2</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v12_9>9</a>; <a href=Zec.htm#v14_1>14:1</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v14_7>7</a>, <a href=Zec.htm#v14_12>12</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v14_15>15</a>).

If we are those who repent, confess our sins, and ask God for His purging (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_9>1&nbsp;John 1:9</a>), we will have the enjoyment of God in Christ in His house, the local church, and in His city, the universal church. This enjoyment, as the &ldquo;good&rdquo; mentioned here, includes God&rsquo;s building up the church, His filling the church with His glory, and His granting the church His rich presence with Himself as joy, peace, life, light, security, and every spiritual blessing (cf. <a href=Eph.htm#v1_3>Eph. 1:3</a>)."
