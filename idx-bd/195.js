BD["a4*\x9b"]="<b>sat</b><br> &emsp; From <a href=Heb.htm#v1_3>1:3</a> this book points us continually to the Christ seated in heaven. In all his other Epistles Paul presents to us mainly the Christ who dwells in our spirit (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_10>Rom. 8:10</a>; <a href=2Ti.htm#v4_22>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:22</a>) as the life-giving Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>) to be our life and our everything. But in this book he points us particularly to the Christ who has sat down in heaven and who is of so many aspects, that He may care for us in every way. In Paul&rsquo;s other Epistles the indwelling Christ is versus our flesh, self, and natural man. In this book the heavenly Christ is contrasted to the earthly religion and all earthly things. To experience the indwelling Christ, we need to turn to our spirit and contact Him. To enjoy the heavenly Christ, we need to look away from all things on earth unto Him, who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God. By His death and resurrection He accomplished everything that is needed by both God and man. Now in His ascension He is sitting in the heavens, in the person of the Son of God (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_5>1:5</a>) and the Son of Man (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_6>2:6</a>), in the person of God (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_8>1:8</a>) and man (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_6>2:6</a>), as the appointed Heir of all things (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_2>1:2</a>), the anointed One of God (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_9>1:9</a>), the Author of our salvation (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_10>2:10</a>), the Sanctifier (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_11>2:11</a>), the constant Succor (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_16>2:16</a>), the instant Helper (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_16>4:16</a>), the Apostle from God (<a href=Heb.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>), the High Priest (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_17>2:17</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v4_14>4:14</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v7_26>7:26</a>), the Minister of the true tabernacle (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_2>8:2</a>) with a more excellent ministry (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_6>8:6</a>), the surety and the Mediator of a better covenant (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_22>7:22</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v8_6>8:6</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v12_24>12:24</a>), the Executor of the new testament (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_16>9:16</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v9_17>17</a>), the Forerunner (<a href=Heb.htm#v6_20>6:20</a>), the Author and Perfecter of faith (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_2>v. 2</a>), and the great Shepherd of the sheep (<a href=Heb.htm#v13_20>13:20</a>). If we look to Him as such a wonderful and all-inclusive One, He will minister heaven, life, and strength to us, transfusing and infusing us with all that He is, that we may be able to run the heavenly race and live the heavenly life on earth. In this way He will carry us through all the lifelong pathway and lead and bring us into glory (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_10>2:10</a>)."

Both snow and wool are naturally white. Hence, as a result of God&rsquo;s washing, we become not only white but also naturally white, as if we had never been defiled. The washing that makes us as white as snow is a positional washing from without through the blood of Jesus Christ (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_7>1&nbsp;John 1:7</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v1_3>Heb. 1:3b</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v1_5>Rev. 1:5</a>), whereas the washing that makes us white like wool is a washing of our nature metabolically from within by God&rsquo;s Spirit and by His life (<a href=1Co.htm#v6_11>1&nbsp;Cor. 6:11</a> and <a href=1CoN.htm#n6_11x1>note</a>; <a href=Tit.htm#v3_5>Titus 3:5</a> and <a href=TitN.htm#n3_5x4>note 4</a>).

Here is an exception: Christ&rsquo;s blood has redeemed us from our old, vain manner of life, because the emphasis here is not on sinfulness but on the manner of life. The whole chapter emphasizes the holy manner of life that God&rsquo;s chosen people should have in their sojourn. Not only is the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification for this, even Christ&rsquo;s redemption is for this&mdash;to separate us from our vain manner of life handed down from our fathers. Knowing that this was accomplished with the highest price, the precious blood of Christ, we should pass the days of our sojourning in fear (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_17>v. 17</a>).<br> &emsp; Our old manner of life, a life in lusts (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_14>v. 14</a>), had no meaning and no goal; hence, it was vain.

In Hebrew the root of the word for expiation means to cover. Thus, to make expiation means to cover sins; it does not mean to take away sins. Since Christ as the Lamb of God took away the sin of the world (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>John 1:29</a>) by offering Himself once for all on the cross as the sacrifice for sins (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_14>v. 14</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_12>10:12</a>), His blood, which He sprinkled in the heavenly tabernacle (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_24>12:24</a>), has accomplished an eternal redemption for us, even the redemption of the transgressions under the first (old) covenant (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_15>v. 15</a>), transgressions that were only covered by animal blood. Thus, we have been redeemed with the precious blood of Christ (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_18>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:18</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_19>19</a>).
