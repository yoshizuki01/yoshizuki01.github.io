This word is abiding, and as the word of life (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_1>1&nbsp;John 1:1</a>), it is also living. All men of flesh, all withering and fading human beings, should receive Christ, the glory of God (<a href=Isa.htm#v40_5>v. 5</a>), who comes to people as the living and abiding word of God. Those who receive Christ as this word of God are regenerated (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>John 1:1</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_12>12</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_13>13</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_23>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:23</a>) that they may become a part of the new creation (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:17</a>) and may have eternal life to live forever (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_15>John 3:15</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_16>16</a>).

BD[":Z6\x97"]="<b>thanksgiving</b><br> &emsp; This psalm tells us that some of the saints of God were offering burnt offerings and other kinds of offerings (vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v50_8>8</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v50_13>13</a>), but because they were lacking in affection, they would not offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving to God. Thus, the psalmist, speaking for God, indicated that what God wants is not the burnt offering but the thanksgiving offering. We can offer certain offerings without being touched in our hearts, but when we are thankful to God and offer to Him a prayer of thanksgiving, our hearts are deeply touched and we are filled with affection and tender feeling toward God. This is the kind of offering God desires."

In the second death, their soul and spirit, after being rejoined to their body in resurrection, are cast with their body into the lake of fire.
