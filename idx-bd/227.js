He was a person not only soaked and saturated with the thought of God but also constituted with the speaking God Himself. Hence, the word that proceeded out of his mouth was the word of God.

In contrast, in the proper church life there is oneness and harmony: all the believers have one mind with one opinion, and one mouth with one speaking (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_10>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:10</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v15_5>Rom. 15:5</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v15_6>6</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v2_2>Phil. 2:2</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v4_2>4:2</a>).
