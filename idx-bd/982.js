The twelve pillars, representing the twelve tribes of Israel, indicate that in the sight of God the twelve tribes should be pillars as a testimony of God, a reflection of what God is in His virtues and attributes as portrayed in the law. The law was not given for God&rsquo;s people to keep or observe; it was given that the people might become God&rsquo;s testimony by being redeemed, terminated, replaced, and reconstituted by Christ through the cross (cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v8_3>Rom. 8:3</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_4>4</a>)."
