BD["]),\x9a"]="<b>faith</b><br> &emsp; The economy of God is a matter in faith, i.e., a matter that is initiated and developed in the sphere and element of the faith. God&rsquo;s economy, which is to dispense Himself into His chosen people, is not in the natural realm nor in the work of law but in the spiritual sphere of the new creation through regeneration by faith in Christ (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_23>Gal. 3:23</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v3_26>26</a>). By faith we are born of God to be His sons, partaking of His life and nature to express Him. By faith we are put into Christ to become the members of His Body, sharing all that He is for His expression. This is God&rsquo;s plan (dispensation), which is carried out in faith, according to His New Testament economy."

To be sanctified is to be saturated with God as our possession for our enjoyment today. Our sanctification will consummate in our maturity in the divine life that we may resemble God and be qualified to fully possess and enjoy Him as our inheritance in the coming age and for eternity."
