This sin, personified in <a href=Rom.htm#v7>Rom. 7</a> (see <a href=RomN.htm#n7_8x1>note 8<sup>1</sup></a> there), is the evil nature of Satan, even Satan himself, who dwells in our fallen flesh (<a href=Rom.htm#v7_17>Rom. 7:17</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v7_18>18a</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v7_20>20</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v7_23>23</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n7_18x2>note 18<sup>2</sup></a>).
