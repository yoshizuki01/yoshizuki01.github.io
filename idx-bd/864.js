BD[":l\@\x97"]="<b>They</b><br> &emsp; Here they refers to the enemies, to the unbelievers; goings refers to God&rsquo;s activities; and the sanctuary signifies the church."
BD["O4+\x97"]="<b>read</b><br> &emsp; The Pharisees said that it was not lawful for the Lord&rsquo;s disciples to pick the ears in the grainfields and to eat; thus, they condemned the disciples for acting contrary to the Scriptures. But the Lord answered, &ldquo;Have you not read&hellip;?&rdquo; pointing out to them another aspect of the Scriptures that justified Him and His disciples. The Pharisees were thus condemned for lacking adequate knowledge of the Scriptures."
BD["P/1\x97"]="<b>set</b><br> &emsp; The result of the keeping of tradition is the setting aside of the commandment of God. Furthermore, tradition causes people to set aside the commandment of God &ldquo;nicely&rdquo;!"
BD["Q*7\x97"]="<b>thing</b><br> &emsp; Lit., word."
BD["O3.\x97"]="<b>stumbled</b><br> &emsp; This word implies that John the Baptist might have been stumbled because of the Lord, because the Lord did not act on his behalf according to his way. Here the Lord encouraged him to take the way He had ordained for him, that he might be blessed. This blessing is very much related to participation in the kingdom of the heavens."
BD["O3-\x9a"]="<b>deaf</b><br> &emsp; The deaf signify those who cannot hear God. After being saved, they can hear the Lord&rsquo;s voice (<a href=Joh.htm#v10_27>John 10:27</a>)."
BD["P.4\x97"]="<b>proclaimed</b><br> &emsp; See <a href=MrkN.htm#n1_14x2>note 14<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Mrk.htm#v1>ch. 1</a>."
BD["Q):\x97"]="<b>years</b><br> &emsp; Lit., her days."
BD["O21\x97"]="<b>not</b><br> &emsp; The twelve apostles (sent to the house of Israel, not to the Gentiles), as workers worthy of their food, did not need to bring their necessities with them. (However, the Lord&rsquo;s workers sent to the Gentiles should take nothing from the Gentiles&mdash;<a href=3Jo.htm#v7>3&nbsp;John 7</a>.) This principle was changed after the Lord had been fully rejected by the house of Israel (<a href=Luk.htm#v22_35>Luke 22:35</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v22_38>38</a>)."
BD["(V-)o226"]="<b>(3)</b>&nbsp; Meeting Joseph again"
BD["O14\x97"]="<b>physician</b><br> &emsp; In calling people to follow Him for the kingdom, the King of the heavenly kingdom ministered as a Physician, not as a Judge. A judge&rsquo;s judgment is according to righteousness, whereas a physician&rsquo;s healing is according to mercy and grace. Those whom He made people of His heavenly kingdom were lepers (<a href=Mat.htm#v8_2>8:2</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v8_4>4</a>), paralytics (<a href=Mat.htm#v8_5>8:5</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v8_13>13</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v9_2>9:2</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v9_8>8</a>), the fever-ridden (<a href=Mat.htm#v8_14>8:14</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v8_15>15</a>), the demon-possessed (<a href=Mat.htm#v8_16>8:16</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v8_28>28</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v8_32>32</a>), those ill with all kinds of diseases (<a href=Mat.htm#v8_16>8:16</a>), despised tax collectors, and sinners (vv. <a href=Mat.htm#v9_9>9</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v9_11>11</a>). If He had visited these pitiful people as a Judge, all would have been condemned and rejected, and none would have been qualified, selected, and called to be the people of His heavenly kingdom. However, He came to minister as a Physician, to heal, recover, enliven, and save them that they might be reconstituted to be His new and heavenly citizens, with whom He could establish His heavenly kingdom on this corrupted earth."
BD["P+=\x97"]="<b>He</b><br> &emsp; &ldquo;He is beside Himself&rdquo; was an exclamation expressing the natural concern for the Slave-Savior on the part of His relatives. It opened the way for the scribes to blaspheme Him (<a href=Mrk.htm#v3_22>v. 22</a>)."
BD["P*\@\x97"]="<b>Pharisees</b><br> &emsp; See <a href=MrkN.htm#n2_6x1>note 6<sup>1</sup></a>."
BD["R++\x97"]="<b>born</b><br> &emsp; Or, born from above. So in <a href=Joh.htm#v3_7>v. 7</a>. To be born anew is to be born from above, from heaven, that is, to be born from God, who is in heaven."
BD["O.=\x97"]="<b>heart</b><br> &emsp; The kingdom people must send their treasure to heaven so that their heart also can be in heaven."
BD["P)C\x97"]="<b>authority</b><br> &emsp; It was not power but authority that cast out the demon. For His service the Slave-Savior had divine authority not only to teach people (<a href=Mrk.htm#v1_22>v. 22</a>) but also to cast out demons."
BD["R*.\x97"]="<b>six</b><br> &emsp; The six waterpots signify the created man, for man was created on the sixth day (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_27>Gen. 1:27</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v1_31>31</a>)."
BD["O-\@\x97"]="<b>first</b><br> &emsp; We must first be reconciled to our brother so that our remembrance of the offense can be removed and our conscience can be void of offense. Then we can come and offer our gift to the Lord and fellowship with Him with a pure conscience. The King of the kingdom will never allow two brothers who are not reconciled to each other either to share the kingdom in its reality or to reign in its manifestation."
BD["O->\x9d"]="<b>Moreh</b><br> &emsp; I.e., fool. A Hebrew expression of condemnation indicating a rebel (<a href=Num.htm#v20_10>Num. 20:10</a>). This expression is more serious than &ldquo;Raca,&rdquo; an expression of contempt."
