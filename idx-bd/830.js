BD["a))\x98"]="<b>many</b><br> &emsp; In the Old Testament, God spoke to the people not once for all and in only one way but in many portions and in many ways: in one portion to the Patriarchs in one way, in another portion through Moses in another way; in one portion through David in one way, in other portions through a number of prophets in several different ways.<br> &emsp; It is most fitting and meaningful that this book, a book of God&rsquo;s speaking, is entitled The Epistle to the Hebrews. The first Hebrew was Abraham (<a href=Gen.htm#v14_13>Gen. 14:13</a>), the father of all those who contact God by faith (<a href=Rom.htm#v4_11>Rom. 4:11</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v4_12>12</a>). Therefore, God is called &ldquo;the God of the Hebrews&rdquo; (<a href=Exo.htm#v9_1>Exo. 9:1</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v9_13>13</a>). The root of the word Hebrew means to pass over. It can mean specifically to pass over a river, that is, to pass over from this side of the river to the other side, to pass over from one side to another. Therefore, a Hebrew is a river crosser. Abraham was such a one. From Chaldea, the land of idolatry, which was on the other side of the great river Euphrates, he crossed over to Canaan, the land of the worship of God, which was on this side of the Euphrates (<a href=Jos.htm#v24_2>Josh. 24:2</a>-<a href=Jos.htm#v24_3>3</a>). The intention of God&rsquo;s speaking in this book was that the Jews who believed in the Lord but still lingered in Judaism would leave the law and cross over to grace (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_16>4:16</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v7_18>7:18</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v7_19>19</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v12_28>12:28</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v13_9>13:9</a>), that they would leave the old covenant and cross over to the new covenant (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_6>8:6</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v8_7>7</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v8_13>13</a>), and that they would leave the ritualistic service of the Old Testament and cross over to the spiritual reality of the New Testament (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_5>8:5</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v9_9>9:9</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v9_14>14</a>); that is, that they would leave Judaism and cross over to the church (<a href=Heb.htm#v13_13>13:13</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_25>10:25</a>), that they would leave the earthly things and cross over to the heavenly things (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_18>12:18</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v12_24>24</a>), that they would leave the outer court, where the altar is, and cross over to the Holiest of all, where God is (<a href=Heb.htm#v13_9>13:9</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v13_10>10</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_19>10:19</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_20>20</a>), that they would leave the soul and cross over to the spirit (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_12>4:12</a>), and that they would leave the beginning of truth and life and cross over to the maturity of life in the truth (<a href=Heb.htm#v5_11>5:11</a>&mdash;<a href=Heb.htm#v6_1>6:1</a>). Not only the Jews who believed in the Lord but all who contact God by faith should be such river crossers. This is the purpose of God&rsquo;s speaking in this book."
