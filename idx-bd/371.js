His followers not only shared His being rejected by the Jews (<a href=Mat.htm#v13_53>13:53</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v13_58>58</a>) but also were persecuted and even martyred by Gentile politics (<a href=Mat.htm#v14_1>14:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v14_12>12</a>). They were in a deserted place with Him in a situation of poverty, yet they were richly cared for by Him (<a href=Mat.htm#v14_13>14:13</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v14_21>21</a>). When they were on the stormy sea under the contrary wind, He walked on the sea, calmed the storm, and brought them through (<a href=Mat.htm#v14_22>14:22</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v14_34>34</a>). At that point many sick ones were healed by touching Him (<a href=Mat.htm#v14_35>14:35</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v14_36>36</a>), but the hypocritical worshippers of God came to heckle Him because His followers transgressed their tradition (<a href=Mat.htm#v15_1>15:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v15_20>20</a>). Then His disciples followed Him to a Gentile region, where a demon-possessed Gentile was healed (<a href=Mat.htm#v15_21>15:21</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v15_28>28</a>). After that, they followed Him along the sea of Galilee and up the mountain, where all kinds of sick people were healed and the need of His followers and the crowd was again richly provided for in a barren wilderness (<a href=Mat.htm#v15_29>15:29</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v15_39>39</a>). After that, both the fundamentalists and the modernists of that day came to tempt Him, and He indicated that He would die to be a unique sign to them (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_1>16:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_4>4</a>). Then He charged His followers to beware of the leaven of both the fundamentalists and the modernists (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_5>16:5</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_12>12</a>). After all that, He brought His followers to the border of the Holy Land, close to a Gentile land, that they might have a revelation of Him, of the church, and of the cross as the way for them to enter into the kingdom (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_13>16:13</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_28>28</a>). Finally, He brought them into glory in the manifestation of the kingdom (vv. <a href=Mat.htm#v17_1>1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v17_8>8</a>)."

The Savior&rsquo;s compassion also was unique in His loving sympathy&mdash;in His tender mercy He offered His power of resurrection to raise the widow&rsquo;s son from death, without being asked to do so. This indicates His unique commission, which was to come to save lost sinners (<a href=Luk.htm#v19_10>19:10</a>), and shows the high standard of His morality, as a Man-Savior, in saving sinners."

Leprosy is the most contaminating and damaging disease, much more serious than a fever (<a href=Mrk.htm#v1_30>v. 30</a>), causing its victim to be isolated from God and from men (see notes <a href=MatN.htm#n8_2x1>2<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n8_3x1>3<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v8>Matt. 8</a>). The cleansing of the leper signifies the recovering of the sinner to the fellowship with God and with men. This was the consummating part of the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s gospel service according to the record of this chapter.<br> &emsp; The Slave-Savior&rsquo;s gospel service to God comprised (1) preaching (vv. <a href=Mrk.htm#v1_14>14</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v1_15>15</a>, <a href=Mrk.htm#v1_38>38</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v1_39>39</a>) to announce the glad tidings to the miserable people in bondage; (2) teaching (vv. <a href=Mrk.htm#v1_21>21</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v1_22>22</a>) to enlighten the ignorant ones in darkness with the divine light of the truth; (3) casting out demons (vv. <a href=Mrk.htm#v1_25>25</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v1_26>26</a>) to annihilate Satan&rsquo;s usurpation of man; (4) healing man&rsquo;s sick condition (vv. <a href=Mrk.htm#v1_30>30</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v1_31>31</a>) that man might serve the Slave-Savior; and (5) cleansing the leper (vv. <a href=Mrk.htm#v1_41>41</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v1_42>42</a>) to recover the sinner to the fellowship with God and with men. What a wonderful and excellent work!"

He was a type of Christ, who, as the Prophet sent by God to His people (<a href=Deu.htm#v18_15>Deut. 18:15</a>, <a href=Deu.htm#v18_18>18</a>), would turn from Israel to the Gentiles, would be buried in the heart of the earth for three days, and would then be resurrected, becoming a sign to that generation for salvation. The Lord&rsquo;s word here implies that for that evil and adulterous Jewish and religious generation, the Lord would do nothing but die and be resurrected as a sign, the greatest sign, to them that they might be saved if they would believe."

This forced Him to forsake His natural relationship with them (<a href=Mat.htm#v12_46>12:46</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v12_50>50</a>). Then in <a href=Mat.htm#v13_53>13:53</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v13_58>58</a> He was rejected by the Galileans also. Now in <a href=Mat.htm#v14>ch. 14</a>, Matthew, in his arranging of events according to doctrine, unveils to us how Gentile politics treated the King&rsquo;s forerunner. It was evil and full of corruption and darkness. To this point Matthew has given a full picture of the Jews&rsquo;, the Galileans&rsquo;, and the Gentiles&rsquo; rejection of the ministry of the kingdom of the heavens."
BD["T),\x97"]="<b>designated</b><br> &emsp; Or, marked out. Before His incarnation Christ, the divine One, already was the Son of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_18>John 1:18</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_3>Rom. 8:3</a>). By incarnation He put on an element, the human flesh, which had nothing to do with divinity; that part of Him needed to be sanctified and uplifted by passing through death and resurrection. By resurrection His human nature was sanctified, uplifted, and transformed. Hence, by resurrection He was designated the Son of God with His humanity (<a href=Act.htm#v13_33>Acts 13:33</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v1_5>Heb. 1:5</a>). His resurrection was His designation. Now, as the Son of God, He possesses humanity as well as divinity. By incarnation He brought God into man; by resurrection He brought man into God, that is, He brought His humanity into the divine sonship. In this way the only begotten Son of God was made the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity. God is using such a Christ, the firstborn Son, who possesses both divinity and humanity, as the producer and as the prototype, the model, to produce His many sons (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>8:29</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_30>30</a>)&mdash;we who have believed in and received His Son.
