BD["S+.\x97"]="<b>Silver</b><br> &emsp; Peter did not possess silver and gold, but St. Peter&rsquo;s Cathedral in Rome was constructed with a superabundance of gold. He did not have silver and gold, but he had the name, the person, of Jesus Christ. He was poor in silver and gold but rich in Christ. The Roman Church is filled with gold but not with the person of Christ. She is rich in gold but poor in Christ."
BD["O3:\x97"]="<b>neither</b><br> &emsp; John, coming to bring men to repentance (<a href=Mrk.htm#v1_4>Mark 1:4</a>) and to cause them to grieve for sin, had no taste for eating and drinking (<a href=Luk.htm#v1_15>Luke 1:15</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v1_17>17</a>); whereas Christ, coming to bring salvation to sinners and to cause them to rejoice in it, had the joy of eating and drinking with them (<a href=Mat.htm#v9_10>9:10</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v9_11>11</a>). The kingdom people, who are under no regulation, follow the divine wisdom, concentrating on the indwelling Christ, who is their wisdom (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>), not on the outward manner of life."

BD["(>*\x99"]="<b>offer</b><br> &emsp; Isaac, a type of Christ as the promised seed (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_16>Gal. 3:16</a>), was given to Abraham by God. Here God asked Abraham to give back to God what God had given him. This surely was a test to Abraham (<a href=Gen.htm#v22_1>v. 1</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v11_17>Heb. 11:17</a>). This shows a basic principle in God&rsquo;s economy: all that God has given us, even what He has wrought in us and through us, must eventually be offered back to Him, that we may live a life of faith, not holding on to anything, even to the things given by God, but relying only on Him. After Isaac was offered, he was returned to Abraham in resurrection and became a blessing (vv. <a href=Gen.htm#v22_12>12</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v22_13>13</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v22_16>16</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v22_18>18</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v11_19>Heb. 11:19</a>). Likewise, after we have offered to God what we have received of Him, He will return it to us in resurrection and it will become a blessing for the fulfillment of His purpose. See <a href=Rom.htm#v4_17>Rom. 4:17</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n4_17x1>notes</a>."

They were all Galileans (<a href=Act.htm#v1_11>v. 11</a>). For them to stay in Jerusalem, especially under the Jewish leaders&rsquo; threatening, meant that they were risking their lives."
