The peoples signify the unbelievers, the heathen: the Philistines, who lived between Egypt and the good land, signify the people of the religious world (<a href=1Sa.htm#v6_1>1&nbsp;Sam. 6:1</a>-<a href=1Sa.htm#v6_18>18</a> and <a href=1SaN.htm#n6_4x1>note 4<sup>1</sup></a>); the Edomites, the descendants of Esau (<a href=Gen.htm#v36_1>Gen. 36:1</a>), signify those who are natural, those who are not chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed (<a href=Rom.htm#v9_10>Rom. 9:10</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v9_13>13</a>); the descendants of Lot, the Moabites, signify the fleshly ones, for their source was an act of incest (<a href=Gen.htm#v19_30>Gen. 19:30</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v19_38>38</a>); and the Canaanites are related to the evil powers in the heavenlies (<a href=Eph.htm#v6_12>Eph. 6:12</a>). The intention of all the enemies was to keep God&rsquo;s people from reaching His goal&mdash;the building of His dwelling place for the fulfillment of His purpose. Nevertheless, in the eyes of God His goal has already been achieved. Thus, Moses used the perfect tense when speaking of God&rsquo;s habitation (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v15_13>13</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v15_17>17</a>) and the apostle John used the past tense in describing the New Jerusalem (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>Rev. 21:2</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>22:5</a>)."
