BD["a4*\x99"]="<b>Author</b><br> &emsp; Or, Originator, Inaugurator, Leader, Pioneer, Forerunner. The same Greek word as in <a href=Heb.htm#v2_10>2:10</a>. All the overcoming saints in the Old Testament are only witnesses of faith, whereas Jesus is the Author of faith. He is the Originator, the Inaugurator, the source, and the cause of faith. In our natural man we have no believing ability. We do not have faith by ourselves. The faith by which we are saved is the precious faith that we have received from the Lord (<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_1>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:1</a>). When we look unto Jesus, He as the life-giving Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>) transfuses us with Himself, with His believing element. Then, spontaneously, a kind of believing arises in our being, and we have the faith to believe in Him. This faith is not of ourselves but of Him who imparts Himself as the believing element into us that He may believe for us. Hence, He Himself is our faith. We live by Him as our faith; i.e., we live by His faith (<a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20</a>), not by our own.<br> &emsp; As the Author and the source of faith, Jesus is also the Leader, the Pioneer, and the Forerunner of faith. He cut the way of faith and, as the Forerunner, took the lead to pioneer it. Hence, He can carry us in His footsteps through the pathway of faith. As we look to Him as the Originator of faith in His life and in His path on earth, and as the Perfecter of faith in His glory and on His throne in heaven, He transfuses and even infuses us with the faith that He originated and perfected."
