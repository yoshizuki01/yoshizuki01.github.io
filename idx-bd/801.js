God did not condemn the worldly Philistines for using a cart to move the Ark, but He would not tolerate the same action by His people. Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty the oxen stumbled, and when Uzzah, with a good intention, reached out for the Ark of God and took hold of it, he was killed instantly.

He makes us holy by imparting Himself, the Holy One, into our being, that our whole being may be permeated and saturated with His holy nature. For us, God&rsquo;s chosen ones, to be holy is to partake of God&rsquo;s divine nature (<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_4>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:4</a>) and to have our whole being permeated with God Himself.
