BD["?91\x97"]="<b>heart</b><br> &emsp; Even this word regarding the deceitful and incurable heart of man is related to God&rsquo;s economy with His dispensing. Although man&rsquo;s heart is corrupt and deceitful and its condition is incurable, even such a heart can be a tablet upon which God writes His law of life (<a href=Jer.htm#v31_33>31:33</a>; cf. <a href=2Co.htm#v3_3>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:3</a>). This reveals that God has a way to impart Himself into man. Once He has come into man, God will spread from man&rsquo;s spirit into his heart. This is God&rsquo;s way, according to His economy, to deal with the heart of fallen man. See <a href=Ezk.htm#v36_26>Ezek. 36:26</a> and <a href=EzkN.htm#n36_26x1>note</a>."
