BD["_)-\x97"]="<b>every</b><br> &emsp; These words, compared with every church in <a href=Act.htm#v14_23>Acts 14:23</a>, indicate not only that the jurisdiction of a local church is the city in which it is located but also that in one city there should be only one church. The eldership of a local church should cover the entire city in which that church is located. Such a unique presbytery in a city preserves the unique oneness of the Body of Christ from damage. One city should have only one church with one presbytery. This practice is illustrated, beyond any question or doubt, by the clear pattern in the New Testament (<a href=Act.htm#v8_1>Acts 8:1</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v13_1>13:1</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v16_1>Rom. 16:1</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v1_2>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:2</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v1_11>Rev. 1:11</a>) and is an absolute prerequisite for the maintaining of proper order in a local church. Because of this, the first thing the apostle charged Titus to do in setting things in order was to appoint elders in every city."
