It implies that wherever a strange tongue is spoken, people&rsquo;s unbelief is there.

The title of <a href=Psa.htm#v102>Psa. 102</a> indicates that it is a prayer of an afflicted one, one who was suffering. The psalmist, a godly one, was suffering because of the destruction and devastation of Zion with the temple and the holy city. This psalm has three sections: vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v102_1>1</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v102_11>11</a>, concerning suffering and affliction; vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v102_12>12</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v102_22>22</a>, concerning the rebuilding of Zion, the restoration of the destroyed temple and the holy city; and vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v102_23>23</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v102_28>28</a>, unveiling the Lord as the One who is everlasting in His resurrection. That this psalm concerns Christ is indicated by the fact that vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v102_25>25</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v102_27>27</a> are quoted in <a href=Heb.htm#v1_10>Heb. 1:10</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v1_12>12</a>."

He proved, examined, and tested their hearts continually (<a href=Psa.htm#v26_2>Psa. 26:2</a>; <a href=Psa.htm#v139_23>139:23</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v139_24>24</a>)."

This day of Christ&rsquo;s judgment on earth will be brought in by His coming back. He was designated by God to execute this judgment, and God&rsquo;s raising Him from the dead is strong proof of this. In their preaching to the Gentiles, both Peter in <a href=Act.htm#v10_42>10:42</a> and Paul here and in <a href=Act.htm#v24_25>24:25</a> stressed the coming judgment of God."
