Whereas the side chambers signify the fullness of Christ (see <a href=EzkN.htm#n41_6x1>note 6<sup>1</sup></a>), this building signifies the riches of Christ, which are unlimited (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_8>Eph. 3:8</a>). Christ is so rich that He is able to fulfill all the requirements and meet all the needs of both God and man and still have an abundance left over (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v6_11>John 6:11</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v6_13>13</a>).

The number eight signifies resurrection. That David as the eighth son was chosen by God indicates that his association with Christ was in resurrection.
