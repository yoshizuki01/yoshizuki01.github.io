This means, in this chapter on regeneration, that regeneration not only brings the divine life into the believers and annuls the satanic nature in their flesh, but it also makes them the corporate bride for Christ&rsquo;s increase. The last two points, the annulling of the serpentine nature in the believers and the believers&rsquo; being made the bride of Christ, are fully developed in John&rsquo;s Revelation. The book of Revelation reveals mainly how Satan as the old serpent will be fully eliminated (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_2>Rev. 20:2</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_10>10</a>) and how Christ&rsquo;s bride, the New Jerusalem, will be fully produced (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>Rev. 21:2</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_10>10</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_27>27</a>)."

BD["Q7+\x97"]="<b>parable</b><br> &emsp; In answering the self-righteous Pharisees and scribes, who condemned Him for eating with sinners, the Savior spoke three parables, unveiling and depicting how the Divine Trinity works to bring sinners back, through the Son by the Spirit, to the Father. The Son came in His humanity as the Shepherd to find the sinner as a lost sheep and bring him back home (vv. <a href=Luk.htm#v15_4>4</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v15_7>7</a>). The Spirit seeks the sinner as a woman carefully seeks a lost coin until she finds it (vv. <a href=Luk.htm#v15_8>8</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v15_10>10</a>). And the Father receives the repenting and returned sinner as the &ldquo;certain man&rdquo; here receives his prodigal son (vv. <a href=Luk.htm#v15_11>11</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v15_32>32</a>). The entire Divine Trinity treasures the sinner and participates in bringing him back to God. All three parables stress the love of the Divine Trinity more than the fallen condition and repentance of the penitent sinner. The divine love is fully expressed in the Son&rsquo;s tender care as the good shepherd, in the Spirit&rsquo;s fine seeking as the treasure-lover, and in the Father&rsquo;s warm receiving as a loving father."

Then God began to execute the sentence He had imposed on him. He has executed, and will execute, this sentence on different occasions and to different degrees, such as through the seventy disciples in this chapter, through Christ on the cross (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_14>Heb. 2:14</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v12_31>John 12:31</a>), through the man-child and Michael before the great tribulation, when Satan will be cast down to the earth (<a href=Rev.htm#v12_5>Rev. 12:5</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v12_7>7</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v12_10>10</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v12_13>13</a>), and through the angel before the millennium, when Satan will be cast into the abyss, the bottomless pit (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_1>Rev. 20:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_3>3</a>).

BD[":|+\x97"]="<b>two</b><br> &emsp; The bronze altar for the sacrifices and the golden altar of incense. The two altars signify the leading consummations of the work of the incarnated Triune God, who is Christ as the embodiment of God for His increase. The mentioning of these two altars together in <a href=Exo.htm#v40_5>Exo. 40:5</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v40_6>6</a> indicates that they are closely related in our spiritual experience. At the bronze altar, a type of the cross of Christ, our problems before God are solved through the crucified Christ as the sacrifices. This qualifies us to enter into the tabernacle, a type of Christ as the incarnated and enterable Triune God, and to contact God at the incense altar. At the golden altar of incense in front of the Holy of Holies (see <a href=HebN.htm#n9_4x1>note 4<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v9>Heb. 9</a>), the resurrected Christ in His ascension is the incense for us to be accepted by God in peace. Through our prayer at the incense altar we enter into the Holy of Holies&mdash;our spirit (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_19>Heb. 10:19</a>)&mdash;where we experience Christ as the Ark of the Testimony with its contents. Through such an experience of Christ we are incorporated into the tabernacle, the incarnated Triune God, to become a part of the corporate Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_12>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:12</a>) as God&rsquo;s testimony for His manifestation. See notes <a href=ExoN.htm#n16_33x1>33<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v16>Exo. 16</a> and <a href=JerN.htm#n31_33x1P2>33<sup>1</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=Jer.htm#v31>Jer. 31</a>."
