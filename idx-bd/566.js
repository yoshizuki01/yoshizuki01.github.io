BD["P37\x97"]="<b>cast</b><br> &emsp; In His ministry for the spreading of the gospel in Galilee in <a href=Mrk.htm#v1_14>1:14</a>&mdash;<a href=Mrk.htm#v10_52>10:52</a>, the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s work was to proclaim the gospel, teach the truth, cast out demons, and heal the sick. In that work His human virtues with His divine attributes were expressed as His qualification for and beauty in His divine service rendered to sinners for God. In His preparation in Jerusalem for His redemptive work (<a href=Mrk.htm#v11_15>11:15</a>&mdash;<a href=Mrk.htm#v14_42>14:42</a>), His major work was to confront the opposing Jewish leaders, who should have been the builders of God&rsquo;s building (<a href=Mrk.htm#v12_9>12:9</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v12_10>10</a>) but had actually been usurped by God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, and instigated by him to plot to kill Him. In this confrontation, under their subtle and evil questioning, testing, and examining, His human dignity was expressed in His human genuineness (vv. <a href=Mrk.htm#v11_15>15</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v11_18>18</a>), and His divine wisdom and authority were expressed in His human conduct and perfection (<a href=Mrk.htm#v11_27>11:27</a>&mdash;<a href=Mrk.htm#v12_37>12:37</a>), so that eventually His faultfinders became His quality-provers. This paved the way for Him to point out to these blind opposers that He, the Christ, the Son of David, was the Lord of David, that is, the very God (<a href=Mrk.htm#v12_35>12:35</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v12_37>37</a>), that they might know His deity in His humanity, that is, that He was God living in man."
