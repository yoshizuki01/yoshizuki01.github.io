In this verse he defended himself by saying that because God is faithful, the word of their preaching was not yes and no. Hence, they were not fickle persons of yes and no. Their being was according to their preaching. They lived according to what they preached."

Sonship in this spirit includes the life, the position, the living, the enjoyment, the birthright, the inheritance, and the manifestation of a son. Such an all-inclusive sonship is now in our spirit."
BD["S*R\x97"]="<b>teaching</b><br> &emsp; The first group of believers produced through the apostles&rsquo; preaching and ministering of Christ on the day of Pentecost continued steadfastly in four things: teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayers. Teaching is the unveiling of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church; fellowship is the communion and communication between the believers in their communion and communication with God the Father and Christ the Son; breaking of bread is the remembrance of the Lord in His accomplishing of God&rsquo;s full redemption; and prayer is cooperation with the Lord in heaven for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy on earth. The first two, teaching and fellowship, conjoined by and to be one group, are of the apostles, but breaking of bread and prayers are not, indicating that besides the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, the believers in Christ should not have any other teaching and fellowship. In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy there is only one category of teaching revealed and recognized by God&mdash;the teaching of the apostles&mdash;and only one category of fellowship that is of God and is acceptable to Him&mdash;the fellowship of the apostles, which is with the Father and the Son, Jesus Christ (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;John 1:3</a> and <a href=1JoN.htm#n1_3x3>note 3</a>), and which is the unique fellowship of the unique church, the Body of Christ. The last two, the breaking of bread and prayer, also conjoined by and to be another group, are practices of the believers in their Christian life and are not related directly to God&rsquo;s economy for the keeping of the oneness of the church, the Body of Christ. Hence, they are not of the apostles, who brought in God&rsquo;s New Testament revelation and His fellowship among all the believers in Christ."
BD["R9.\x97"]="<b>Your</b><br> &emsp; Your name, here and in <a href=Joh.htm#v17_26>v. 26</a>, means the very name Father. The name God and the name Jehovah were adequately revealed to man in the Old Testament, but the name Father was not, though it was mentioned briefly in <a href=Isa.htm#v9_6>Isa. 9:6</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v63_16>63:16</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v64_8>64:8</a>. The Son came and worked in the Father&rsquo;s name (<a href=Joh.htm#v5_43>5:43</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v10_25>10:25</a>) to manifest the Father to the men whom the Father gave Him and to make the Father&rsquo;s name known to them (<a href=Joh.htm#v17_26>v. 26</a>). That name reveals the Father as the source of life (<a href=Joh.htm#v5_26>5:26</a>) for the propagation and multiplication of life. Many sons would be born of the Father (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_12>1:12</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_13>13</a>) to express the Father. Hence, the Father&rsquo;s name is very much related to the divine life."

The renewing of the mind, which results from setting the mind on the spirit (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_6>8:6</a>), is the base for the transformation of our soul. Our mind is the leading part of our soul, and as it is renewed, our will and emotion automatically follow to be renewed also. To be renewed means that a new element is wrought into our being. This produces an inward metabolic transformation, making us suitable for the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the practice of the church life. All the virtues and the overcoming in chs. <a href=Rom.htm#v12>12</a>&mdash;<a href=Rom.htm#v16>16</a> also are the results of this transformation."

BD["U.4\x97"]="<b>All</b><br> &emsp; The fourth matter dealt with by this Epistle is the abuse of freedom in foods and in the body (vv. <a href=1Co.htm#v6_12>12</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v6_20>20</a>). Foods for man to exist and sex (pertaining to the body) for man to propagate are both necessary and ordained by God. Man has the right to use them. However, he should not abuse them, nor should he be under their power, controlled and enslaved by them. Abusive eating, such as the eating of things sacrificed to idols, stumbles the weak brothers (<a href=1Co.htm#v8_9>8:9</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v8_13>13</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v10_28>10:28</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v10_30>30</a>, <a href=1Co.htm#v10_32>32</a>), and excessive eating damages our body. Both foods and our stomach will be done away with; God will bring both to nothing. The abuse of sex is fornication. Not only is it condemned by God; it also destroys our body (<a href=1Co.htm#v6_18>v. 18</a>), which is for the Lord."

This indicates that the service of the believers is an issue of the growth in life described in the foregoing chapters. It indicates further that this service must be in the Body, the church.
