BD["c)>\x9a"]="<b>brotherly</b><br> &emsp; Since the purifying of our souls causes our entire being to be concentrated on God that we may love Him with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our mind (<a href=Mrk.htm#v12_30>Mark 12:30</a>), such purifying issues in unfeigned brotherly love, our loving from the heart fervently those whom God loves. First, God&rsquo;s regeneration issues in a holy living (vv. <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_15>15</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_16>16</a>); then God&rsquo;s sanctification (purification) issues in brotherly love."
BD["b-<\x97"]="<b>sinner</b><br> &emsp; According to the context of these two verses, this is not an unbelieving sinner but a believing brother who has been led astray from the truth and is turned back from his error to the truth. Hence, the salvation of his soul does not refer to the eternal salvation of the person but to the dispensational salvation of his soul from the suffering of physical death under God&rsquo;s discipline. James may also have considered all the virtues covered in vv. <a href=Jam.htm#v5_7>7</a>-<a href=Jam.htm#v5_20>20</a> to be aspects of practical Christian perfection."
BD["e)-\x97"]="<b>And</b><br> &emsp; In addition to the three main things&mdash;life, fellowship, and joy&mdash;presented in the preceding verses, a further message, which the apostles heard from the Lord, is to announce to the believers that God is light."

Through that judgment all the ungodly will be cast into the lake of fire for destruction (see <a href=2PeN.htm#n2_3x1>note 3<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=2Pe.htm#v2>ch. 2</a>). Since it will be the final judgment upon men and the demons (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_13>Rev. 20:13</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n20_13x1>note</a>), it is of the greatest relevance to the government of God in the universe. See <a href=1PeN.htm#n1_17x2P2>note 17<sup>2</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=1Pe.htm#v1>1&nbsp;Pet. 1</a>.<br> &emsp; Here Peter skipped over the millennium of one thousand years, going directly from the Lord&rsquo;s coming to the judgment of the great white throne. To him, as to the Lord, that one thousand years will be like one day (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_8>v. 8</a>), a short time. He was dealing here with God&rsquo;s governmental judgment. In God&rsquo;s economy the millennium is not for that purpose."

Peter, like Paul (<a href=2Ti.htm#v4_6>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:6</a>), knew that he would leave the world by martyrdom, and he was now ready for it."

BD["c-2\x9a"]="<b>in</b><br> &emsp; In Christ Jesus indicates that the God of all grace went through all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to accomplish the complete and full redemption that He may bring His redeemed people into an organic union with Himself. Thus they can participate in the riches of the Triune God as their enjoyment. All the steps of the divine operation are in Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God and who became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the bountiful life supply to us. It is in this Christ, through His all-inclusive redemption and based on all His achievements, that God can be the God of all grace to call us into His eternal glory and to perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us in the Triune God (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_1>1:1</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_2>2</a>) as the solid foundation, thus enabling us to attain His glorious goal. What a miracle that fallen sinners could be brought into God&rsquo;s eternal glory! And how excellent is His perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding work in us! This is all accomplished through His &ldquo;all grace,&rdquo; which is the &ldquo;true grace&rdquo; (<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_12>v. 12</a>)."

The believers, having believed into Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_15>John 3:15</a>) and having been baptized into His name (<a href=Act.htm#v19_5>Acts 19:5</a>), that is, into Himself (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_27>Gal. 3:27</a>), are in Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>) and are one with Him (<a href=1Co.htm#v6_17>1&nbsp;Cor. 6:17</a>). When they are reproached in His name, they are reproached with Him, sharing in His sufferings (<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_13>v. 13</a>), in the fellowship of His sufferings (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_10>Phil. 3:10</a>)."
BD["a5-\x97"]="<b>love</b><br> &emsp; Surely money lovers cannot enter into the reality of the church life.

The Lord Jesus Christ offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_28>Heb. 9:28</a>), not only for our redemption but also for the satisfying of God&rsquo;s demand, thus appeasing the relationship between us and God. Hence, He is the sacrifice for our propitiation before God."

Regeneration with the divine life is the base, the ground, for the purifying, sanctifying, of our souls unto unfeigned brotherly love. This section of the Word begins and ends with regeneration, which issues in a holy living toward God and brotherly love toward the saints."
