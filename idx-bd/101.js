BD["Z+6\x97"]="<b>love</b><br> &emsp; God is love (<a href=1Jo.htm#v4_16>1&nbsp;John 4:16</a>). Love is the very essence of God&rsquo;s being, the very substance of the divine life. Hence, to put on love is to clothe ourselves with the element of God&rsquo;s life. Such a love is the uniting bond in the combination of perfectness, completeness, and mature virtues. We need to put on not only the new man (<a href=Col.htm#v3_10>v. 10</a>) but also the virtues of the new man (<a href=Col.htm#v3_12>v. 12</a>), and to put on love over all the virtues (<a href=Col.htm#v3_14>v. 14</a>)."
BD["SA3\x97"]="<b>appeal</b><br> &emsp; For his defense Paul wanted to appeal to Caesar (see notes <a href=ActN.htm#n22_1x2>1<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Act.htm#v22>ch. 22</a> and <a href=ActN.htm#n26_32x2>32<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Act.htm#v26>ch. 26</a>). This would allow him to fulfill his desire to see Rome for the furtherance of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony (<a href=Act.htm#v19_21>19:21</a>) and was according to the Lord&rsquo;s indication to him (<a href=Act.htm#v23_11>23:11</a>). Without this appeal he would have been killed by the Jews who plotted against him (cf. <a href=Act.htm#v23_12>23:12</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v23_15>15</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v25_1>25:1</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v25_3>3</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v25_9>9</a>) and would not have been able to write his last eight Epistles. Before his appeal to Rome, he had written only six Epistles: 1 and 2&nbsp;Thessalonians, Galatians, Romans, and 1 and 2&nbsp;Corinthians. During his first imprisonment in Rome he wrote Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Philemon. After that imprisonment he wrote 1&nbsp;Timothy, Titus, and Hebrews. Then, during his second imprisonment he wrote 2&nbsp;Timothy. Without these last eight Epistles, what a lack the divine revelation would have and what a loss the church would have suffered! His appeal did render great profit and benefit to the Lord&rsquo;s interest."

Because he was one with Christ in carrying out God&rsquo;s salvation in Christ, the apostle Paul applied this prophetic word to himself in his ministry of gospel preaching for the turning of the gospel from the Jews, because of their rejection, to the Gentiles. In His ministry on earth the Lord expressed the same thing to the stubborn Jews in <a href=Luk.htm#v4_24>Luke 4:24</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v4_27>27</a>."

BD["U6B\x97"]="<b>has</b><br> &emsp; Has, occurring five times in this verse, is a widely used Greek word, a word with many meanings, of which the following three are the main ones: (1) to hold, to possess, to keep (a certain thing); (2) to have (a certain thing) for enjoyment; (3) to have the means or power to do a certain thing. The first two meanings should be applied to the first three of the five items listed in this verse, and the third to the last two&mdash;a tongue and an interpretation of a tongue. This indicates that when we come to the church meeting, we should have something of the Lord to share with others, whether a psalm to praise the Lord, a teaching (of the teacher) to minister the riches of Christ to edify and nourish others, a revelation (of the prophet, <a href=1Co.htm#v14_30>v. 30</a>) to give visions of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose concerning Christ as God&rsquo;s mystery and the church as Christ&rsquo;s mystery, a tongue for a sign to the unbelievers (<a href=1Co.htm#v14_22>v. 22</a>) that they may know and accept Christ, or an interpretation to make a tongue concerning Christ and His Body understandable. Before coming to the meeting, we should prepare ourselves for the meeting with such things from the Lord and of the Lord, either through our experience of Him or through our enjoyment of His word and fellowship with Him in prayer. After coming into the meeting, we need not wait, and should not wait, for inspiration; we should exercise our spirit and use our trained mind to function in presenting what we have prepared to the Lord for His glory and satisfaction and to the attendants for their benefit&mdash;their enlightenment, nourishment, and building up.<br> &emsp; This is like the Feast of Tabernacles in ancient times. The children of Israel brought the produce of the good land, which they had reaped from their labor on the land, to the feast and offered it to the Lord for His enjoyment and for their mutual participation in fellowship with the Lord and with one another. We must labor on Christ, our good land, that we may reap some produce of His riches to bring to the church meeting and offer. Thus the meeting will be an exhibition of Christ in His riches and will be a mutual enjoyment of Christ shared by all the attendants before God and with God for the building up of the saints and the church.<br> &emsp; According to the stress and emphasis of this Epistle, all five items listed in this verse should focus on Christ as God&rsquo;s center for our portion and the church as God&rsquo;s goal for our aim. The psalm should be the praise to God for giving Christ as wisdom and power to us for our daily life and church life. The teaching from a teacher and the revelation from a prophet should teach and minister Christ and the church, which is the Body of Christ, to people. A tongue and its interpretation also should have Christ and the church as their center and content. Any stress on things other than Christ and the church will bring confusion to the church and distract it from the central lane of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, making it like the church in Corinth."
