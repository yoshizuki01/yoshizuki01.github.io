BD["C))\x97"]="<b>The</b><br> &emsp; The Minor Prophets are composed of twelve books, from Hosea to Malachi. In ancient times these books might have been considered one book. &ldquo;The book of the prophets&rdquo; mentioned by Stephen in <a href=Act.htm#v7_42>Acts 7:42</a>, in his quoting of <a href=Amo.htm#v5_25>Amos 5:25</a>-<a href=Amo.htm#v5_27>27</a>, might refer to this collective book. These twelve books complete the divine revelation concerning God&rsquo;s economy in His dealings with His elect (Israel) and the nations, which is covered in detail in the books of the Major Prophets&mdash;Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel. All the books of both the Major Prophets and the Minor Prophets were called by the Lord Jesus &ldquo;the Prophets,&rdquo; in which things were written concerning Him (<a href=Luk.htm#v24_44>Luke 24:44</a>). Thus, the central point of all the Prophets is Christ (cf. <a href=Luk.htm#v24_27>Luke 24:27</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v5_39>John 5:39</a>).<br> &emsp; Like the Major Prophets, the Minor Prophets unveil that God&rsquo;s economy in His loving chastisement of Israel, in His governmental dealing with Israel, and in His judgment upon the nations issues in the manifestation of Christ as the centrality and universality in God&rsquo;s economy to bring in the kingdom, the age of restoration (<a href=Mat.htm#v19_28>Matt. 19:28</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v3_21>Acts 3:21</a>), which will usher the old and ruined universe into the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_1>Rev. 21:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>2</a>)."

See <a href=Jer.htm#v23_5>Jer. 23:5</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v23_6>6</a> and <a href=JerN.htm#n23_6x3>note 6<sup>3</sup></a>."
