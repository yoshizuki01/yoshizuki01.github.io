BD["R6/\x97"]="<b>If</b><br> &emsp; This chapter unveils the way God dispenses Himself into man. In the dispensing of Himself into us, God is triune. He is one, yet He is three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Son is the embodiment and expression of the Father (vv. <a href=Joh.htm#v14_7>7</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v14_11>11</a>), and the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son (vv. <a href=Joh.htm#v14_17>17</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v14_20>20</a>). In the Son (the Son is even called the Father&mdash;<a href=Isa.htm#v9_6>Isa. 9:6</a>) the Father is expressed and seen, and as the Spirit (<a href=2Co.htm#v3_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:17</a>) the Son is revealed and realized. The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son as the Spirit is realized in the believers. God the Father is hidden, God the Son is manifested among men, and God the Spirit enters into man to be his life, his life supply, and his everything. Hence, this Triune God&mdash;the Father in the Son and the Son as the Spirit&mdash;dispenses Himself into us to be our portion that we may enjoy Him as our everything in His divine trinity."

BD["T+>\x97"]="<b>faith</b><br> &emsp; Or, faith in Jesus Christ.

This object is Jesus, who is God incarnate. When man hears Him, knows Him, appreciates Him, and treasures Him, He causes faith to be generated in man, enabling man to believe in Him. Thus, He becomes the faith in man by which man believes in Him. Hence, this faith becomes the faith in Him, and it is also the faith that belongs to Him.<br> &emsp; In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, God desires that man believe in Jesus, who is God incarnate. If man does not believe in Him, he commits the unique sin before God (<a href=Joh.htm#v16_9>John 16:9</a>). However, if man believes in Him, he is righteous to the uttermost before God, and God reckons this faith as his righteousness. At the same time, this faith brings its object, that is, this One who is God incarnate, into those who believe in Him. He is God&rsquo;s righteousness, and God has given Him as righteousness to those who are indwelt by Him (<a href=Jer.htm#v23_6>Jer. 23:6</a>). All this is out of, and depends on, the faith that is in Him and of Him (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_2>Heb. 12:2</a>)."

According to the teaching of the New Testament in <a href=Eph.htm#v1_13>Eph. 1:13</a> and <a href=Gal.htm#v3_2>Gal. 3:2</a>, they must have received the Holy Spirit essentially when they believed for their regeneration (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_6>John 3:6</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v3_36>36</a>). But they had not yet received the Spirit economically to identify them with the Body of Christ. The reason the Holy Spirit did not fall upon them outwardly and economically was so that the apostles, through whom the practical establishing of the church had been initiated in Jerusalem, might come to bring them into identification with the Body of Christ. This case is different from that of the ones in the house of Cornelius, who, when they believed in the Lord, received the Holy Spirit both essentially within them for regeneration and economically upon them for baptism into the Body of Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_13>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:13</a>) and identification with the Body of Christ.
