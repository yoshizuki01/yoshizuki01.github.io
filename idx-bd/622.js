BD["`)-\x97"]="<b>love</b><br> &emsp; In the initial stage of the life of a believer, faith comes first, and then, out of faith, love is produced (<a href=Gal.htm#v5_6>Gal. 5:6</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v1_15>Eph. 1:15</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v1_4>Col. 1:4</a>; see notes <a href=1TiN.htm#n1_14x2>14<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=1Ti.htm#v1>1&nbsp;Tim. 1</a> and <a href=EphN.htm#n6_23x2>23<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Eph.htm#v6>Eph. 6</a>). But here love is mentioned first and then faith, because the matter of the equal status of the believers, dealt with in this Epistle, is a matter of love, which comes out of faith. In the new man the members love one another in faith (<a href=Tit.htm#v3_15>Titus 3:15</a>). Their relationship is of love through faith. The apostle appreciated the fellowship of Philemon&rsquo;s faith (<a href=Phm.htm#v6>v. 6</a>) and was encouraged by his love (<a href=Phm.htm#v7>v. 7</a>); thus, he entreated Philemon to receive Onesimus because of this love (<a href=Phm.htm#v9>v. 9</a>). These two virtues are referred to in combination here; Philemon had both of them, not only toward the Lord but also to all the saints."
