Material riches are for the human natural life in this age, a life that is temporal and, hence, not real. If we do good with material things, we will accomplish something for the real life, laying away a treasure for our enjoyment in the eternal life in the next age. This requires that we lay hold on God&rsquo;s eternal life, which is the real life. Otherwise, we will lay hold on our human natural life in laying away a treasure of material riches in this age for a life that is not real. We should care for the eternal life rather than the natural life. Both <a href=1Ti.htm#v6_12>v. 12</a> and this verse stress the eternal life of God. This indicates that the divine life is a factor that is crucial and vital to our Christian life."
