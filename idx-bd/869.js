BD["<)*\x97"]="<b>Vanity</b><br> &emsp; The word can also be translated vapor, breath. So throughout the book. The contents of Ecclesiastes are a description by Solomon, after his falling away from God (<a href=1Ki.htm#v11_1>1&nbsp;Kings 11:1</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v11_8>8</a>) and returning back to God, of the human life of fallen mankind under the sun, a life in the corrupted world (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_12>Eph. 2:12</a>). According to this book human history, from its beginning to the present, is vanity. Through all the positive and negative experiences of the human life under the sun, Solomon was deeply impressed and occupied with the vanity of vanities of the human life under the sun in its falling away from God. Man was created by God with the highest and most noble purpose, that is, to express God in His image with His divine life and nature (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_26>Gen. 1:26</a> and <a href=GenN.htm#n1_26x3>note 3</a>). But God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan the devil, came in to inject himself as sin into the man God created for His purpose (<a href=Gen.htm#v3_1>Gen. 3:1</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v3_6>6</a>). Through this fall, man and all the created things that had been committed by God to man&rsquo;s dominion were brought into the slavery of corruption and made subject to vanity (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_20>Rom. 8:20</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_21>21</a>). Thus, the human life in the corrupted world also became vanity, a chasing after wind (<a href=Ecc.htm#v1_14>v. 14</a>). The writer fully realized this and stressed this to the uttermost in his description. Yet he was not fully disappointed in this; rather, he instructed men that there is a way to escape this vanity, i.e., to come back to God and take God as man&rsquo;s everything, man&rsquo;s redemption, life, wealth, enjoyment, pleasure, and satisfaction (<a href=Ecc.htm#v12_13>12:13</a>), that man may still be used by God to fulfill His original purpose in creating man, for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal economy."

BD["a)*\x98"]="<b>Son</b><br> &emsp; In the Old Testament, God spoke in the prophets, in men borne by His Spirit (<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_21>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:21</a>). In the New Testament, He speaks in the Son, in the person of the Son. The Son is God Himself (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_8>v. 8</a>), God expressed. God the Father is hidden; God the Son is expressed. No one has ever seen God; the Son, as the Word of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>John 1:1</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v19_13>Rev. 19:13</a>) and the speaking of God, has declared Him with a full expression, explanation, and definition of Him (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_18>John 1:18</a>).<br> &emsp; The Son is the center, the focus, of this book. In the Godhead He is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of God&rsquo;s substance. In creation He is (1) the means through which the universe was made (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_2>v. 2</a>); (2) the power that upholds and bears all things (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_3>v. 3</a>); and (3) the Heir appointed to inherit all things. In redemption He accomplished the purification of man&rsquo;s sins and is now sitting on the right hand of God in the heavens (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_3>v. 3</a>).<br> &emsp; This book reveals to us the contrast between the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament was of the law in letters and forms, of man, earthly, temporary, and by sight and issued in a religion called Judaism. The New Testament is of life, spiritual, heavenly, permanent, and by faith and is focused in a person who is the Son of God."
BD["^,<\x98"]="<b>sick</b><br> &emsp; Why did the apostle leave in sickness one who was so intimate to him, without exercising healing prayer for him? Why did he not exercise his healing gift (<a href=Act.htm#v19_11>Acts 19:11</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v19_12>12</a>) to cure Timothy of his stomach sickness rather than instruct him to take the natural way for healing (<a href=1Ti.htm#v5_23>1&nbsp;Tim. 5:23</a>)? The answer to both questions is that he and his co-workers were under the discipline of the inner life in that time of suffering rather than under the power of the outward gift. The former is a matter of grace in life; the latter is a matter of gift in power&mdash;miraculous power. In the decline of the church and in one&rsquo;s suffering for the church, the gift of power is not needed as much as the grace in life."
