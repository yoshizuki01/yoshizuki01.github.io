BD["(.6\x99"]="<b>pitch</b><br> &emsp; The root of the words pitch in this verse and expiation elsewhere in the Old Testament means primarily to cover. The pitch here is a type of the redeeming blood of Christ, which covers God&rsquo;s building within and without (<a href=Lev.htm#v4_5>Lev. 4:5</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v4_7>7</a>; <a href=Lev.htm#v6_30>6:30</a>; <a href=Lev.htm#v16_14>16:14</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v16_19>19</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v9_21>Heb. 9:21</a>). The pitch within the ark was for the peace of Noah and his family (cf. <a href=Heb.htm#v9_14>Heb. 9:14</a>), whereas the pitch without was for God&rsquo;s satisfaction (cf. <a href=Exo.htm#v12_13>Exo. 12:13</a>). Noah and his family were saved from the judgment of the flood by the pitch on the ark, signifying that the believers in Christ are saved from God&rsquo;s judgment by the redeeming blood of Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_9>Rom. 5:9</a>).<br> &emsp; In order for the pitch on the ark to be effective, Noah and his family had to be in the ark, i.e., in union with the ark. Likewise, in order to apply the redemption through Christ&rsquo;s blood, we must be in Christ, i.e., in union with Him by believing into Him (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_16>John 3:16</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v1_7>Eph. 1:7</a>).

BD["O+.\x97"]="<b>baptized</b><br> &emsp; To baptize people is to immerse them, to bury them, in water, which signifies death. John the Baptist did this to indicate that he who repents is good for nothing but burial. Further, this signifies that the old person has been terminated so that a new beginning can be realized in resurrection, to be brought in by Christ as the Life-giver. Hence, after John&rsquo;s ministry, Christ came. John&rsquo;s baptism not only terminated those who repented but also ushered them to Christ for life. Baptism in the Bible implies death and resurrection. To be baptized into water is to be put into death and buried. To be raised up from the water means to be resurrected from death."

BD["AS4\x97"]="<b>mountain</b><br> &emsp; To be on the mountain is to be in resurrection and in the position of ascension. This indicates that the church life must be high, on the top of the mountain (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_5>Eph. 2:5</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_6>6</a>). The church must also be holy, separated and sanctified from anything worldly (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_17>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:17</a>).<br> &emsp; The law of God&rsquo;s house is related to God&rsquo;s character. God is a God of height, i.e., in resurrection and ascension, and He is a God who is holy. Likewise, in position the church is high, and in nature the church is most holy. If in our church life we are in resurrection and in the position of ascension and if we are most holy, then we can be God&rsquo;s habitation."
