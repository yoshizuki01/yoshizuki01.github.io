BD["e-9\x97"]="<b>unrighteousness</b><br> &emsp; Every wrongdoing, everything that is not just or righteous, is sin (cf. <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_4>3:4</a> and <a href=1JoN.htm#n3_4x2>note 2</a>)."
BD["e-8\x9a"]="<b>life</b><br> &emsp; Undoubtedly, this refers to spiritual life imparted, through the prayer of the asker, into the one for whom he is asking.

BD["e+?\x97"]="<b>commandment</b><br> &emsp; This is a summary of the commandments in the preceding and succeeding verses. All the commandments are summarized in two: to believe in the name of God&rsquo;s Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another. The first concerns faith; the second, love. To have faith is to receive the divine life in our relationship with the Lord; to love is to live the divine life in our relationship with the brothers. Faith touches the source of the divine life; love expresses the essence of the divine life. Both are needed for the believers to live a life that abides in the Lord."
