BD[":)*\x97"]="<b>law</b><br> &emsp; Psalms <a href=Psa.htm#v1>1</a> and <a href=Psa.htm#v2>2</a> portray a contrast between the human concept and the divine revelation. The human concept exalts the law and the law-keeper as one blessed by God, whereas the divine revelation proclaims Christ as the One anointed of God in God&rsquo;s economy. In <a href=Psa.htm#v1>Psa. 1</a> the psalmist, according to his human, ethical concept, appreciated and uplifted the law to the uttermost. This is contrary to the divine concept in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. In its nature the law is holy, righteous, good, and spiritual (<a href=Rom.htm#v7_12>Rom. 7:12</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v7_14>14a</a>), but in its position, the law is not in the main line of God&rsquo;s economy; rather, it entered in alongside the main line of God&rsquo;s economy (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_20>Rom. 5:20a</a>). God created man in His image and according to His likeness (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_26>Gen. 1:26</a>) with the intention that man would receive God as life in the tree of life (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_8>Gen. 2:8</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>9</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v2_16>16</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_17>17</a>) so that man could live God and express God. This is the main line of God&rsquo;s economy. But while this main line was proceeding, Satan came in to deceive man and constitute man with sin (<a href=Gen.htm#v3_1>Gen. 3:1</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v3_6>6</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v5_19>Rom. 5:19</a>). In order to continue His purpose with man after man&rsquo;s fall, God added the law to the main line of His economy (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_19>Gal. 3:19</a> and notes <a href=GalN.htm#n3_19x1>1</a> and <a href=GalN.htm#n3_19x2>2</a>). According to <a href=Gal.htm#v4_24>Gal. 4:24</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v4_25>25</a> (see <a href=GalN.htm#n4_24x5>note 24<sup>5</sup></a> there), the position of the law is that of a concubine. A concubine does not have an orthodox position. Thus, to appreciate and uplift the law is to bring a &ldquo;concubine&rdquo; into God&rsquo;s economy. This is absolutely against God&rsquo;s ordination.<br> &emsp; The entire book of Psalms presents a contrast between the law and Christ. Only Christ Himself, not the law, can make us members of Christ and conform us to Christ that we may be His complement (<a href=Eph.htm#v5_30>Eph. 5:30</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v5_32>32</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>Rom. 8:29</a>). The spirit of the Scriptures does not exalt anything or anyone other than Christ (<a href=Mat.htm#v17_1>Matt. 17:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v17_5>5</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v3_7>Phil. 3:7</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_8>8</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v1_15>Col. 1:15</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v1_19>19</a>). Eventually, by the end of the Psalms the only thing that remains is Christ with His complement, which is His Body, His church, the house and kingdom of God in God&rsquo;s economy to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.<br> &emsp; In the book of Psalms, as in the entire Bible, there are two lines: the line of the tree of life, the line of life, and the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the line of death (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_8>Gen. 2:8</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>9</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v2_16>16</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_17>17</a> and <a href=GenN.htm#n2_9x3P2>note 9<sup>3</sup>, par. 2</a>). In addition to these two lines, the line of the law runs alongside the line of life. God&rsquo;s purpose in giving the law was to lead His people to Christ (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_23>Gal. 3:23</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v3_24>24</a>), i.e., to the line of life (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n25_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v25>Exo. 25</a>). However, if the law as the side line is exalted improperly, it becomes part of the line of the tree of knowledge, the line of death (<a href=Rom.htm#v7_7>Rom. 7:7</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v7_11>11</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_6>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:6b</a>). God has ordained Christ to be the centrality and universality of His economy to fulfill His good pleasure (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_9>Eph. 1:9</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_10>10</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v3_8>3:8</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v3_11>11</a>). The law has been ended by Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v10_4>Rom. 10:4a</a>), and the believers are no longer under the law (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_14>Rom. 6:14</a>)."
