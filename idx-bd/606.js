Hence, sonship is stressed in this chapter (vv. <a href=Rom.htm#v8_15>15</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v8_23>23</a>). Sons here indicates a more advanced stage of growth in the divine life than does children in <a href=Rom.htm#v8_16>v. 16</a>, yet not as advanced as heirs in <a href=Rom.htm#v8_17>v. 17</a>. Children refers to the initial stage of sonship, the stage of regeneration in the human spirit. Sons are the children of God who are in the stage of the transformation of their souls. They not only have been regenerated in their spirit and are growing in the divine life, but they also are living and walking by being led by the Spirit. Heirs are the sons of God who, through the transfiguration of their body in the stage of glorification, will be fully matured in every part of their being. Hence, they will be qualified as the legal heirs to claim the divine inheritance (vv. <a href=Rom.htm#v8_17>17</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v8_23>23</a>)."
