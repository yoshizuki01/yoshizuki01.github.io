BD["e+\@\x9a"]="<b>Spirit</b><br> &emsp; Thus far in this Epistle the Spirit has not been referred to, though the Spirit is anonymously implied in the anointing in <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_20>2:20</a> and <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_27>27</a>. Actually, the Spirit, that is, the all-inclusive compound life-giving Spirit (see <a href=PhiN.htm#n1_19x4>note 19<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=Phi.htm#v1>Phil. 1</a>), is the vital and crucial factor of all the mysteries unveiled in this Epistle: the divine life, the fellowship of the divine life, the divine anointing, the abiding in the Lord, the divine birth, and the divine seed. It is by this Spirit that we are born of God, we receive the divine life as the divine seed in us, we have the fellowship of the divine life, we are anointed with the Triune God, and we abide in the Lord. This wonderful Spirit is given to us as the promised blessing of the New Testament (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_14>Gal. 3:14</a>); He is given without measure by the Christ who is above all, who inherits all, and who is to be increased universally (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_31>John 3:31</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_35>35</a>). This Spirit and the eternal life (<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_15>v. 15</a>) are the basic elements by which we live the life that abides in the Lord continuously. Hence, it is by this Spirit, who witnesses assuringly with our spirit, that we are the children of God (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_16>Rom. 8:16</a>) and that we know that the Lord of all abides in us (<a href=1Jo.htm#v4_13>4:13</a>). It is through this Spirit that we are joined to the Lord as one spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v6_17>1&nbsp;Cor. 6:17</a>). And it is by this Spirit that we enjoy the riches of the Triune God (<a href=2Co.htm#v13_14>2&nbsp;Cor. 13:14</a>)."
