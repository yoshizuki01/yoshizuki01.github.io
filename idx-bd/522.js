BD["i.1\x97"]="<b>fifth</b><br> &emsp; The seven seals are divided, first, into groups of four and three and, second, into groups of six and one. The number four signifies the creatures, symbolized by the four living creatures, and the number six signifies creation (creation was completed in six days). The number three signifies the Triune God, and the number one signifies the unique God. Hence, both four plus three and six plus one indicate that the seven seals, through God&rsquo;s judgment, bring God&rsquo;s creation, with all the creatures, to God.<br> &emsp; The fifth seal discloses Christian martyrdom from the first century to the time near the end of this age. (This may include the martyrdom of the Old Testament saints&mdash;<a href=Mat.htm#v23_34>Matt. 23:34</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v23_36>36</a>.) While the preaching of the gospel, as indicated by the first seal, is progressing, the faithful saints are continually being martyred."
