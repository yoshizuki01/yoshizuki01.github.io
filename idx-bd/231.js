Thus, the statute in this chapter was actually ordained by God for Christ&rsquo;s incarnation. All Scripture reveals Christ and is a record concerning Christ, either directly or indirectly (<a href=Luk.htm#v24_27>Luke 24:27</a>, <a href=Luk.htm#v24_44>44</a>). The cities of refuge in <a href=Num.htm#v35>ch. 35</a> are a type of Christ, and the settlement of the problem regarding the inheritance in <a href=Num.htm#v36>ch. 36</a> is related to Christ. If Christ had not been incarnated, He could not have become the cities of refuge for the human race. Thus, in a very real sense, the refuge cities in <a href=Num.htm#v35>ch. 35</a> depend on the statute in <a href=Num.htm#v36>ch. 36</a>."

Here, at the end of the book, we are told that our experience and enjoyment of Christ must take place in our spirit, which has been regenerated to be the dwelling place and vessel of the Triune God. Therefore, this is altogether a matter of the union and mingling of the processed Triune God, who has become the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, and the spirit of us, the tripartite men, who are being transformed by such a Spirit. We must live and act in our wonderful spirit by the Triune God as the wonderful Spirit. Only then can we experience and enjoy the Triune God, who was processed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, as the inexhaustibly sufficient grace and thus become His fullness, His expression."
