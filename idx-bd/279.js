BD["O,4\x97"]="<b>withdrew</b><br> &emsp; John the Baptist ministered in the wilderness, not in the holy temple in the holy city; still, his ministry was in Judea, not far from the &ldquo;holy&rdquo; things. Because of the people&rsquo;s rejection of John, the Lord Jesus withdrew into Galilee to begin His ministry, far away from the holy temple and the holy city. This occurred sovereignly to fulfill the prophecy in <a href=Isa.htm#v9_1>Isa. 9:1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v9_2>2</a>."
BD["O+7\x97"]="<b>righteousness</b><br> &emsp; Righteousness is to be right by living, walking, and doing things in the way God has ordained. In the Old Testament, to be righteous was to keep the law that God had given. Now God sent John the Baptist to institute baptism. To be baptized also is to fulfill righteousness before God, that is, to fulfill the requirement of God. The Lord Jesus came to John not as God but as a typical man, a real Israelite. Hence, He had to be baptized in order to keep this dispensational practice of God; otherwise, He would not have been right with God."

Ramah, located in the territory of Benjamin (<a href=Jos.htm#v18_21>Josh. 18:21</a>-<a href=Jos.htm#v18_28>28</a>), the son of Rachel (<a href=Gen.htm#v35_15>Gen. 35:15</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v35_18>18</a>), was not far from the site of Rachel&rsquo;s tomb.

BD["O)=\x97"]="<b>Jesus</b><br> &emsp; Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua (<a href=Num.htm#v13_16>Num. 13:16</a>), which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah. Hence, Jesus is not only a man but Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our salvation. Thus, He is our Savior. He is also our Joshua, the One who brings us into rest (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_8>Heb. 4:8</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v11_28>Matt. 11:28</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v11_29>29</a>), which is Himself as the good land to us."
BD["M24\x97"]="<b>I</b><br> &emsp; I here refers to Jehovah, indicating that Jehovah will strengthen His people in Himself. They will then walk about in His name, i.e., in His person as the reality of His name (<a href=Mat.htm#v28_19>Matt. 28:19</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n28_19x5>note 5</a>). To be in God&rsquo;s name is to be one with God in our daily walk by our living, walking, and having our being in God&rsquo;s name (cf. <a href=Col.htm#v3_17>Col. 3:17</a>)."
BD["Q)+\x97"]="<b>me</b><br> &emsp; The early church recognized Luke as the author of both this Gospel and the Acts. Luke&rsquo;s authorship is evident from the style of composition of the two books. Luke was a Gentile (<a href=Col.htm#v4_14>Col. 4:14</a>; cf. <a href=Col.htm#v4_11>Col. 4:11</a>), probably an Asiatic Greek, and a physician (<a href=Col.htm#v4_14>Col. 4:14</a>). Beginning in Troas, he joined Paul in his ministry and accompanied him in his last three ministry journeys (<a href=Act.htm#v16_10>Acts 16:10</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v16_17>17</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v20_5>20:5</a>&mdash;<a href=Act.htm#v21_18>21:18</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v27_1>27:1</a>&mdash;<a href=Act.htm#v28_15>28:15</a>). He was a faithful companion of Paul until Paul&rsquo;s martyrdom (<a href=Phm.htm#v24>Philem. 24</a>; <a href=2Ti.htm#v4_11>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:11</a>). Hence, his Gospel should represent Paul&rsquo;s views, as Mark&rsquo;s represents Peter&rsquo;s (see <a href=MrkN.htm#n1_1x1P1>note 1<sup>1</sup>, par. 1</a>, in <a href=Mrk.htm#v1>Mark 1</a>).<br> &emsp; The Gospels of Luke, Matthew, and Mark are synoptic in regard to the Savior&rsquo;s humanity (see <a href=MrkN.htm#n1_1x1P2>note 1<sup>1</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=Mrk.htm#v1>Mark 1</a>). Luke&rsquo;s Gospel reveals God among men in His saving grace given to fallen mankind. Its purpose is to present the Savior as a genuine, normal, and perfect man. It gives a complete genealogy of the man Jesus, from His parents back to Adam, the first generation of mankind, and shows that He is a genuine descendant of man&mdash;a son of man (see <a href=MatN.htm#n1_1x1P2>note 1<sup>1</sup>, pars. 2</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n1_1x1P3>3</a>, in <a href=Mat.htm#v1>Matt. 1</a>). Its record of the life of this man impresses us with the completeness and perfection of His humanity. Hence, this Gospel stresses the Lord as the Man-Savior. Based on the moral principles that apply to all men, it presents gospel messages, as in <a href=Luk.htm#v4_16>4:16</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v4_21>21</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v7_41>7:41</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v7_43>43</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v12_14>12:14</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v12_21>21</a>; and <a href=Luk.htm#v13_2>13:2</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v13_5>5</a>; gospel parables, as in <a href=Luk.htm#v10_30>10:30</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v10_37>37</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v14_16>14:16</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v14_24>24</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v15_3>15:3</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v15_32>32</a>; and <a href=Luk.htm#v18_9>18:9</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v18_14>14</a>; and gospel cases, as in <a href=Luk.htm#v7_36>7:36</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v7_50>50</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v13_10>13:10</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v13_17>17</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v16_19>16:19</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v16_31>31</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v19_1>19:1</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v19_10>10</a>; and <a href=Luk.htm#v23_39>23:39</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v23_43>43</a>. None of these are recorded in the other Gospels. In contrast to Matthew, Luke does not stress the dispensational aspect or the Jewish background. It is the Gospel written to mankind in general, and it announces the good news to all people (<a href=Luk.htm#v2_10>2:10</a>). Its characteristic is absolutely not Jewish but Gentile (<a href=Luk.htm#v4_25>4:25</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v4_28>28</a>). It is a Gospel to all sinners, both Jewish and Gentile. As such, the sequence of its record is according to morality, not according to historical events. See notes <a href=MatN.htm#n8_16x1P2>16<sup>1</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=Mat.htm#v8>Matt. 8</a> and <a href=MrkN.htm#n14_20x1>20<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mrk.htm#v14>Mark 14</a>."

By resting and fasting we can partake of all that the processed Christ has accomplished for us.
