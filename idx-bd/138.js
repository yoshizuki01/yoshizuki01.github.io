BD["R5-\x99"]="<b>feet</b><br> &emsp; In ancient times the Jews wore sandals, and since their roads were dusty, their feet easily became dirty. If, when they came to a feast, they sat at the table and stretched out their feet, the dirt and the smell would certainly frustrate the fellowship. Hence, for the feast to be pleasant they needed foot-washing. The Lord washed His disciples&rsquo; feet to show them that He loved them to the uttermost (<a href=Joh.htm#v13_1>v. 1</a>), and He charged them to do the same to one another in love (vv. <a href=Joh.htm#v13_14>14</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v13_34>34</a>). Today the world is dirty, and we, the saints, are easily contaminated. For us to maintain pleasant fellowship with the Lord and with one another, we need spiritual foot-washing&mdash;with the washing Holy Spirit, the washing word, and the washing life&mdash;carried out both by the Lord in His love and by one another in love. This is absolutely necessary in order for us to live in the fellowship of the divine life, which is revealed in John&rsquo;s first Epistle, a continuation of the Gospel of John."
