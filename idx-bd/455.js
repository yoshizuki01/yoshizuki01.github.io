BD["e)/\x97"]="<b>is</b><br> &emsp; We walk in the light, but God is in the light because He is light. &ldquo;The light is the element in which God dwells: compare <a href=1Ti.htm#v6_16>1&nbsp;Tim. 6:16</a>.&hellip;this walking in the light, as He is in the light, is no mere imitation of God, but is an identity in the essential element of our daily walk with the essential element of God&rsquo;s eternal being: not imitation, but coincidence and identity of the very atmosphere of life&rdquo; (Alford)."
BD["e).\x9a"]="<b>lie</b><br> &emsp; Lying is of Satan; he is the father of liars (<a href=Joh.htm#v8_44>John 8:44</a> and <a href=JohN.htm#n8_44x3>note 3</a>). The satanic darkness is versus the divine light, and the satanic lie is versus the divine truth. As the divine truth is the expression of the divine light, so the satanic lie is the expression of the satanic darkness. If we say that we have fellowship with God, who is light, and walk in the darkness, we lie in the expression of the satanic darkness and do not practice the truth in the expression of the divine light. This verse inoculates against the heretical teaching of the Antinomians, who taught that one is free from the obligation of the moral law and said that one can live in sin and at the same time have fellowship with God."

It may refer to Peter&rsquo;s wife, who traveled with him (<a href=1Co.htm#v9_5>1&nbsp;Cor. 9:5</a>), or to a prominent sister in the Lord, who was chosen by God not only with the recipients of this Epistle but also with Peter and all other believers. Some suppose that it refers to the church."
BD["c,8\x97"]="<b>Christian</b><br> &emsp; Gk. Christianos, a word formed from Latin. The ending ianos, denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire. One who worshipped the emperor, the Caesar, or Kaisar, was called Kaisarianos, which means an adherent of Kaisar, a person who belongs to Kaisar. When people believed in Christ and became His followers, some in the Empire came to consider Christ a rival of their Kaisar. Then, at Antioch (<a href=Act.htm#v11_26>Acts 11:26</a>) they began to call the followers of Christ Christianoi (Christians), adherents of Christ, as a nickname, a term of reproach. Hence, this verse says, &ldquo;As a Christian, let him not be ashamed&rdquo;; that is, if any believer suffers at the hands of the persecutors who contemptuously call him a Christian, he should not feel ashamed but should glorify God in this name.<br> &emsp; Today the term Christian should bear a positive meaning, that is, a man of Christ, one who is one with Christ, not only belonging to Him but also having His life and nature in an organic union with Him, and who is living by Him, even living Him, in his daily life. If we suffer for being such a person, we should not feel ashamed but should be bold to magnify Christ in our confession by our holy and excellent manner of life to glorify (express) God in this name."
BD["a5/\x97"]="<b>Remember</b><br> &emsp; This is essential in the church life. The ministers of the word of God should have a manner of life that issues in an example of faith for the church members, the receivers of the word of God, to imitate. Then the church members not only will receive the word that the ministers minister but also will imitate the ministers&rsquo; faith, which is expressed in their manner of life.<br> &emsp; <a href=Heb.htm#v13_7>Verse 7</a> is a continuation of vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v13_5>5</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v13_6>6</a>. Manner of life must refer to the living and behavior pursued by those ministers of the word of God, in which they had no love of money and were satisfied with what they had (<a href=Heb.htm#v13_5>v. 5a</a>). Their faith must refer to the fact that they trusted in the Lord, their Helper, for their living (vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v13_5>5b</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v13_6>6</a>). The word that they ministered and the life that they lived must have been entirely Christ, and their faith must have been the faith in Christ, of which Christ is both the Author and the Perfecter (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_2>12:2</a>). Such a manner of life and such a faith were surely worthy to be imitated by the believers, who received the word of God that the ministers ministered and who considered the issue of their manner of life."

BD["a42\x97"]="<b>holiness</b><br> &emsp; Holiness is God&rsquo;s nature. To partake of God&rsquo;s holiness is to partake of His holy nature. It was common, unholy, for the Hebrew believers to remain in Judaism. They needed to be sanctified unto God&rsquo;s new covenant so that they could partake of God&rsquo;s holy nature. For that purpose, persecution was aroused to discipline them that they might be sanctified from the common."
