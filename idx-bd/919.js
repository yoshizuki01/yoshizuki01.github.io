All the curses that have befallen the children of Israel have carried out God&rsquo;s governmental dealings in relation to them, so that through these dealings God would eventually be able to accomplish His economy with them to prove that He is the very God who would not change in His will forever. In His governmental dealing with His people, God is wise, loving, sympathetic, patient, purposeful, and successful. God&rsquo;s severe chastisement of the children of Israel does not mean that He has given them up (<a href=Rom.htm#v11_1>Rom. 11:1</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v11_5>5</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v11_11>11</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v11_12>12</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v11_23>23</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v11_32>32</a>).

He dealt with his brothers soberly, wisely, and with discernment, disciplining them according to their need in order to perfect them and build them up that they might be a collective people living together as God&rsquo;s testimony on earth (cf. <a href=Gen.htm#v45_24>45:24</a>). Joseph denied himself and placed himself absolutely under God&rsquo;s sovereign leading, conducting himself wholly for the interest of God and His people. Joseph&rsquo;s living under God&rsquo;s restriction, a portrait of the human living of Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v5_19>John 5:19</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v5_30>30b</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v7_16>7:16</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v7_18>18</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v14_10>14:10</a>), manifested the maturity and perfection of the divine life and brought in God&rsquo;s kingdom."

It is not individual but corporate (<a href=Col.htm#v3_10>Col. 3:10</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v3_11>11</a>). In this corporate new man Christ is all and in all&mdash;He is all the people and in all the people. See <a href=ColN.htm#n3_11x9>note 11<sup>9</sup></a> in <a href=Col.htm#v3>Col. 3</a>.<br> &emsp; This book reveals first that the church is the Body of Christ (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_22>1:22</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>23</a>), the kingdom of God, the household of God (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_19>2:19</a>), and the temple, the dwelling place of God (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_21>2:21</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>22</a>). Here it reveals in addition that the church is the new man. This is the highest aspect of the church. The church is an assembly of the called-out ones. This is the initial aspect of the church. From here, the apostle went on to mention the fellow citizens of the kingdom of God and the members of the household of God. These are higher than the initial aspect, but not as high as the church as the Body of Christ. Yet the new man is higher still than the Body of Christ. Thus, the church is not just an assembly of believers, a kingdom of heavenly citizens, a household of God&rsquo;s children, or even a Body for Christ. It is in its ultimate, uttermost aspect a new man to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life, whereas as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person. This new corporate person should live a life like that which Jesus lived on earth, that is, a life of reality that expresses God and causes God to be realized as the reality by man. Hence, the new man is the focus of the apostle&rsquo;s exhortation in this section (vv. <a href=Eph.htm#v4_17>17</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v4_32>32</a>)."
