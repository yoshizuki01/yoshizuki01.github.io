Our confession of sins and God&rsquo;s forgiveness of our sins are the threshold of the New Testament age (<a href=Mat.htm#v3_1>Matt. 3:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v3_2>2</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v1_4>Mark 1:4</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v1_5>5</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v10_43>Acts 10:43</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v8_12>Heb. 8:12</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_9>1&nbsp;John 1:9</a>)."

This too is a condition of the life that abides in the Lord. To abide in the Lord requires a tranquil heart with a conscience void of offense. This is also vital to our fellowship with God, which was covered in the first section of this Epistle. A heart disturbed by an offended conscience frustrates our abiding in the Lord and breaks our fellowship with God."

Hence, to deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny the Father and the Son. Whoever so denies the divine person of Christ is the antichrist.<br> &emsp; The fact that denying that Jesus is the Christ equals denying the Father and the Son implies the thought that Jesus, Christ, the Father, and the Son are all one. They all are the elements, the ingredients, of the all-inclusive compound indwelling Spirit, who is now anointing the believers all the time (vv. <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_20>20</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_27>27</a>).
