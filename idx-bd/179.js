BD["Z+8\x97"]="<b>word</b><br> &emsp; The word spoken by Christ. In His New Testament economy God speaks in the Son, and the Son speaks not only by Himself in the Gospels but also through His members, the apostles and prophets, in Acts, in the Epistles, and in Revelation. All these speakings can be considered His word.<br> &emsp; In this passage the infilling of spiritual life that overflows in praising and singing is related to the word, whereas in the parallel passage, <a href=Eph.htm#v5_18>Eph. 5:18</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v5_20>20</a>, the infilling of spiritual life is related to the Spirit. This indicates that the word is the Spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_63>John 6:63b</a>). A normal Christian life should be one that is filled with the word, that the Spirit may bubble over with praise and lauding melodies from within the believers.<br> &emsp; This book is focused on Christ as our Head and life. The way for Him to exercise His Headship and minister His riches to us is through His word. Hence, the emphasis is on the word of Christ. Ephesians is concerned with the church as the Body of Christ. The way for us to live a normal church life is to be filled in our spirit unto all the fullness of God. Hence, the Spirit is emphasized. In Ephesians both the Holy Spirit and our spirit are emphasized again and again; the word is even considered to be the Spirit (<a href=Eph.htm#v6_17>Eph. 6:17</a>). However, in this book each of the two spirits is mentioned only once (<a href=Col.htm#v1_8>1:8</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v2_5>2:5</a>). In Ephesians the word is for washing away our natural life (<a href=Eph.htm#v5_26>Eph. 5:26</a>) and fighting against the enemy (<a href=Eph.htm#v6_17>Eph. 6:17</a>), whereas in this book the word is for revealing Christ (<a href=Col.htm#v1_25>1:25</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v1_27>27</a>) in His preeminence, centrality, and universality."
BD["U8>\x97"]="<b>accursed</b><br> &emsp; Gk. anathema, meaning a thing or person accursed; i.e., set apart, devoted, to woe. Our loving God makes us those who are blessed of God to share the divine blessings that He has ordained and prepared for us, which are beyond our apprehension (<a href=1Co.htm#v2_9>2:9</a>). Our not loving the Lord makes us those who are accursed, set apart to a curse. What a warning!"

The subtle one&rsquo;s device is to carry the saints away and thus cause the Body of Christ to collapse."

BD[":\x8e/\x97"]="<b>sparrow</b><br> &emsp; The affliction of the psalmist refers to the affliction of Christ (vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v102_6>6</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v102_8>8</a>). This verse is a particular verse concerning Christ&rsquo;s suffering, which was related to His zeal for God&rsquo;s house (<a href=Joh.htm#v2_17>John 2:17</a>; <a href=Psa.htm#v69_9>Psa. 69:9</a>). Here Christ is likened to a lone sparrow on a housetop, referring to the flat roof of a Jewish house, where people would often go to pray (<a href=Act.htm#v10_9>Acts 10:9</a>). This indicates that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, probably there were times when in the night He, like a lone bird on a housetop, would watch and pray (<a href=Mat.htm#v14_23>Matt. 14:23</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v6_12>Luke 6:12</a>), caring not for His own interest but for the interest of God and of God&rsquo;s house.<br> &emsp; In typology, <a href=Psa.htm#v102>Psa. 102</a> first refers to Christ&rsquo;s suffering, especially to His death. Christ&rsquo;s suffering consummated in His death, and through His death the church, God&rsquo;s house, came into existence. Eventually, the church as God&rsquo;s house becomes God&rsquo;s city, God&rsquo;s kingdom (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_19>19</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v14_17>Rom. 14:17</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_19>Eph. 2:19</a>)."
