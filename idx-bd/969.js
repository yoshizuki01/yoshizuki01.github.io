The moral law, as God&rsquo;s testimony based on His divine attributes, is composed of the Ten Commandments (<a href=Exo.htm#v20_2>20:2</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v20_17>17</a>), the statutes (<a href=Exo.htm#v20_22>20:22</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v20_26>26</a>), and the ordinances (<a href=Exo.htm#v21_1>21:1</a>&mdash;<a href=Exo.htm#v23_19>23:19</a>) and typifies Christ as God&rsquo;s testimony, God&rsquo;s expression (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n20_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v20>ch. 20</a>). The ceremonial law was composed of the laws of the tabernacle, the offerings, the priesthood, and the feasts. The tabernacle typifies Christ as the embodiment of God (<a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>) for God&rsquo;s people to contact Him and to enter into Him for their enjoyment; the offerings typify Christ as all kinds of sacrifices (<a href=Lev.htm#v1>Lev. 1</a>&mdash;<a href=Lev.htm#v7>7</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_5>Heb. 10:5</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_12>12</a>) to meet the need of God toward His people and the need of His people before Him; the priesthood typifies Christ as the High Priest (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_1>Heb. 8:1</a>), who takes care of God&rsquo;s chosen people before God; and the feasts typify Christ as the bountiful enjoyment in every aspect assigned by God to His chosen people (<a href=Col.htm#v2_16>Col. 2:16</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v2_17>17</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v1_19>Phil. 1:19</a>).<br> &emsp; God knew that no man could keep the Ten Commandments, the moral section of His law, to be justified by Him (<a href=Rom.htm#v3_20>Rom. 3:20</a>). Hence, by His grace and according to His economy He also gave His people the ceremonial section of His law that through the priesthood and the offerings the condemned sinners, the breakers of the moral law of God, could be saved from the condemnation under the moral law and could contact God and enter into Him to enjoy Him as their everything. In this way sinners could be justified by God to be righteous men (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v1_19>Matt. 1:19a</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v1_6>Luke 1:6</a>, <a href=Luk.htm#v1_75>75</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v2_25>2:25</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v23_50>23:50</a>) and could have fellowship with God.<br> &emsp; The entire law of God was decreed by God to His people with the intention of exposing and convicting His people by the moral section of His law, that they would be conducted to the ceremonial section of His law, signifying that God&rsquo;s people should be conducted to the all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God for their redemption, salvation, and bountiful enjoyment in every aspect (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_23>Gal. 3:23</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v3_24>24</a>) through all the ages unto eternity."

Instead of commanding the people to keep the law, Moses enacted the covenant by means of an altar, twelve pillars, sacrifices of burnt offerings and peace offerings, and blood (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v24_4>4</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v24_8>8</a>; cf. <a href=Heb.htm#v9_18>Heb. 9:18</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v9_20>20</a>). The altar, symbolizing the cross of Christ (<a href=Heb.htm#v13_10>Heb. 13:10</a>), indicates that as fallen and sinful people, we cannot possibly keep the law of God; hence, we need to be redeemed, terminated, and replaced by Christ through the cross."

This great reality, this great truth, should cause men to know God and thereby to glorify Him and thank Him (<a href=Rom.htm#v1_21>v. 21</a>). However, instead of dealing properly with this reality, this truth, according to righteousness, in which God delights, men held down the truth in unrighteousness, which God hates, and did not approve of knowing God (<a href=Rom.htm#v1_28>v. 28</a>). Therefore, they despised and rejected God, changing the glory of God into idols (vv. <a href=Rom.htm#v1_21>21</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v1_23>23</a>) and casting off self-restraint to fall without limit (vv. <a href=Rom.htm#v1_24>24</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v1_32>32</a>), so that they were given up, abandoned, by God (vv. <a href=Rom.htm#v1_24>24</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v1_26>26</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v1_28>28</a>)."
