In <a href=1Co.htm#v5_7>5:7</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v5_8>8</a> the believers experienced Christ as their Passover and began to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Here in this chapter they are baptized unto their Moses (Christ), passing through their Red Sea (the death of Christ). They are now eating the spiritual food and drinking the spiritual drink that they might take their journey (the Christian race) toward their good land (the all-inclusive Christ). Also, they are warned here (<a href=1Co.htm#v10_11>v. 11</a>) not to repeat the history of the children of Israel in doing evil against God, as illustrated in vv. <a href=1Co.htm#v10_6>6</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v10_11>11</a>.<br> &emsp; The goal of God&rsquo;s calling of the children of Israel was that they would enter into the promised land to enjoy its riches so that they might establish God&rsquo;s kingdom and be God&rsquo;s expression on earth. However, although all Israel was redeemed through the passover, delivered out of the Egyptian tyranny, and brought to the mountain of God to receive the revelation of God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the tabernacle, nearly all fell and died in the wilderness, failing to reach this goal (<a href=Heb.htm#v3_7>Heb. 3:7</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v3_19>19</a>) because of their evildoings and unbelief. Only Caleb and Joshua reached the goal and entered into the good land (<a href=Num.htm#v14_27>Num. 14:27</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v14_30>30</a>). This signifies that although we have been redeemed through Christ, delivered out of Satan&rsquo;s bondage, and brought into the revelation of God&rsquo;s economy, we may yet fail to reach the goal of God&rsquo;s calling, that is, to enter into the possession of our good land, Christ (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_12>Phil. 3:12</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_14>14</a>), and enjoy His riches for the kingdom of God that we may be His expression in the present age and participate in the fullest enjoyment of Christ in the kingdom age (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_21>Matt. 25:21</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v25_23>23</a>).
