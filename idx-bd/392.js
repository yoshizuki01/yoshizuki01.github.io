In our natural being we are not stones but clay. Because we received the divine life with its divine nature through regeneration, we can be transformed into stones, even precious stones, by enjoying Christ as our life supply (<a href=2Co.htm#v3_18>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18</a>). If we do not follow the worldly church but enjoy the Lord in the proper church life, we will be transformed into stones for the building of God. These stones will be justified and approved by the Lord, as indicated by the color white, while the worldly church will be condemned and rejected by Him. God&rsquo;s work of building the church depends on our transformation, and our transformation issues from the enjoyment of Christ as our life supply."
