This second outpouring is different from the pouring out of the Spirit as the late rain on the last day of the tribulation for the salvation of the remnant of the Jews under Antichrist&rsquo;s besieging (<a href=Zec.htm#v12_10>Zech. 12:10</a>).<br> &emsp; In the Bible and in the Minor Prophets four things are unveiled: God&rsquo;s chastisement on His elect people, God&rsquo;s punishment of the nations, the manifestation of Christ, and the restoration. These four matters are covered in Joel, a short book of three chapters. First, God sent the locusts to consume Israel (<a href=Joe.htm#v1_2>1:2</a>&mdash;<a href=Joe.htm#v2_11>2:11</a>). This was God&rsquo;s chastisement because of Israel&rsquo;s great evils. Then, this book reveals that God will punish and judge the Gentile nations because in their consuming of Israel they are excessive, acting without regard for justice (<a href=Joe.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>-<a href=Joe.htm#v3_16>16a</a>, <a href=Joe.htm#v3_19>19</a>). God&rsquo;s chastising of Israel and His punishing of the nations issue in the manifestation of Christ. Regarding this manifestation, Joel speaks here concerning the outpouring of the processed, consummated, compound Spirit, i.e., the Spirit of God compounded with Christ&rsquo;s humanity, Christ&rsquo;s death and its effectiveness, and Christ&rsquo;s resurrection with its power (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n30_25x1>note 25<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v30>Exo. 30</a>). This is the Holy Spirit, who was poured out on the day of Pentecost (<a href=Act.htm#v2_1>Acts 2:1</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v2_4>4</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v2_16>16</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v2_21>21</a>), and this Spirit is the consummated Triune God and the realization of Christ for the manifestation of Christ. This manifestation began with the incarnation of Christ and has been confirmed and strengthened by the outpouring of the Spirit, for through that outpouring the individual Christ became the corporate Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_12>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:12</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v12_13>13</a>), the church as the great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>-<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_16>16</a>). The church as the manifestation of Christ will bring in the glorious day of restoration, the age of the millennial kingdom (<a href=Joe.htm#v3_16>3:16</a>-<a href=Joe.htm#v3_21>21</a>), in which Christ will be manifested in a fuller way. The restoration will consummate in the fullest manifestation of Christ in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_1>Rev. 21:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>2</a>).

Job&rsquo;s three friends, however, insisted that Job&rsquo;s sufferings were a proof that he had done something wrong and was being judged by God. Thus, God came in to condemn the three friends and to vindicate Job to a certain extent.<br> &emsp; Nevertheless, Job was devoid of the divine revelation, not knowing that God&rsquo;s purpose in dealing with His people is that He wants His people to gain Him, to partake of Him, to possess Him, and to enjoy Him, rather than all things, until their enjoyment reaches the fullest extent (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_7>Phil. 3:7</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_14>14</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v4_16>2&nbsp;Cor. 4:16</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v4_17>17</a>), as the divine revelation ultimately unveils in the New Testament, that His people may ultimately become the New Jerusalem (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>Rev. 21:2</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>22:5</a>)."

First, seven weeks (forty-nine years) were apportioned from the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem (<a href=Neh.htm#v2_1>Neh. 2:1</a>-<a href=Neh.htm#v2_8>8</a>) to the completion of the rebuilding. Second, sixty-two weeks (434 years) were apportioned from the completion of the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the cutting off (crucifixion) of the Messiah (<a href=Dan.htm#v9_26>v. 26</a>). Third, the last week of seven years will be for Antichrist to make a firm covenant with the people of Israel (<a href=Dan.htm#v9_27>v. 27</a>).<br> &emsp; There is a gap of unknown duration between the first sixty-nine weeks and the last week of the seventy weeks. This gap is the age of mystery, the age of grace, the age of the church (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_3>Eph. 3:3</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v3_11>11</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v5_32>5:32</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v1_27>Col. 1:27</a>).

At the end of the last week of the seventy weeks, after Christ has married His bride, He with His bridal army will come as the stone cut out without hands and will crush the great human image from the toes to the head, destroying the human government that fights against God directly. Through this crushing the problem of human government in the old creation will be solved. Then Christ with His overcomers will increase to become a great mountain that fills the whole earth (<a href=Dan.htm#v2_34>2:34</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v2_35>35</a> and <a href=DanN.htm#n2_34x1>notes</a>)."
