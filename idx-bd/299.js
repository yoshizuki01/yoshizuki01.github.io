BD["d+.\x97"]="<b>which</b><br> &emsp; Referring to water in <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_5>v. 5</a>. The earth was compacted out of water and through water in an orderly condition. But through the same water it was judged and destroyed by the flood at Noah&rsquo;s time (<a href=Gen.htm#v7_17>Gen. 7:17</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v7_24>24</a>), indicating that all things did not continue in the same way from the beginning of creation."

First, in <a href=Gen.htm#v1_1>Gen. 1:1</a> the earth came into existence, and then, in <a href=Gen.htm#v1_9>Gen. 1:9</a>, also by the word (the speaking) of God (<a href=Psa.htm#v33_9>Psa. 33:9</a>), the earth began to be compacted out of water and through water, that is, to stand together with water in juxtaposition, emerging partly from the water and remaining partly submerged under water."

BD["d)4\x97"]="<b>present</b><br> &emsp; I.e., the truth that is present with the believers, which they have already received and now possess. In the first section of this chapter, vv. <a href=2Pe.htm#v1_3>3</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_11>11</a>, Peter used the provision of the divine life for the proper Christian life to inoculate against the apostasy. In the second section, vv. <a href=2Pe.htm#v1_12>12</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_21>21</a>, he used the revelation of the divine truth, as the second antidote, to inoculate against the heresy in the apostasy, a heresy similar to today&rsquo;s modernism. The provision of life and the revelation of truth are the antidotes used by Peter in dealing with the apostasy."

BD["c,4\x97"]="<b>fiery</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word for fiery ordeal means burning, signifying the burning of a smelting furnace for the purifying of gold and silver (<a href=Prv.htm#v27_21>Prov. 27:21</a>; <a href=Psa.htm#v66_10>Psa. 66:10</a>); this is similar to the metaphor used in <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_7>1:7</a>. Peter considered the persecution that the believers suffered as such a burning furnace used by God to purify their life. This is God&rsquo;s way to deal with the believers in the judgment of His governmental administration, which begins from His own house (vv. <a href=1Pe.htm#v4_17>17</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_19>19</a>)."

So, in suffering persecution we should show others that we have Christ as Lord within us. This is to sanctify Him, to separate Him, from the other gods, not degrading Him so that He appears to be like the lifeless idols."
