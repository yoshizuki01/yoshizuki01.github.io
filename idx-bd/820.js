This kingdom is the church (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_19>19</a>). John, the writer of the book, was in this kingdom (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_9>v. 9</a>), and all redeemed and reborn believers also are a part of this kingdom (<a href=Rom.htm#v14_17>Rom. 14:17</a>).<br> &emsp; One of the main aspects of this book is that God is recovering His right over the earth in order to make the whole earth His kingdom (<a href=Rev.htm#v11_15>11:15</a>). When Christ came, He brought the kingdom of God with Him (<a href=Luk.htm#v17_21>Luke 17:21</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v12_28>Matt. 12:28</a>). This kingdom has been enlarged into the church (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_19>19</a>), which will accomplish the establishing of the kingdom of God on the whole earth. On one hand, the kingdom of God today is in the church, but on the other hand, the kingdom of God is coming through the overcoming believers (<a href=Rev.htm#v12_10>12:10</a>). Then Christ and the overcoming believers will reign over all the nations in the millennial kingdom (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_26>2:26</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v2_27>27</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v12_5>12:5</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>20:4</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>)."
