In order to receive food from Joseph, the people had to pay four kinds of prices: their money, their livestock, their land, and themselves (vv. <a href=Gen.htm#v47_14>14</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v47_23>23</a>). Money represents convenience, livestock signifies the means of living, and land represents resources. If we would receive the life supply from the Lord, we must give Him our convenience, our means of livelihood, and our resources. The more we give Him, the more life supply we will receive from Him. Ultimately, in order to receive the best portion from the Lord, including food for satisfaction and seed for reproduction (<a href=Gen.htm#v47_23>v. 23</a>), we must hand ourselves, every part of our being, over to Him.<br> &emsp; Eventually, there was only one landlord in Egypt, and all the people became enjoyers on the same level.

In this supplement none of the kings of Israel is included because all those kings forsook both the proper ground, the ground of Jerusalem (<a href=1Ki.htm#v12_25>1&nbsp;Kings 12:25</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v12_33>33</a>), and the fundamental faith given by God through Moses. Thus, God forsook them because of their apostasy. Unlike the kings of Israel, the kings of Judah remained on the ground of the unity of God&rsquo;s chosen people and kept the oneness according to the fundamental teaching of Moses (<a href=2Ch.htm#v13_4>13:4</a>-<a href=2Ch.htm#v13_11>11</a>).
