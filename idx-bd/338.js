BD["e)+\x9a"]="<b>Father</b><br> &emsp; Only the Father and the Son are mentioned here, not the Spirit, because the Spirit is implied in the fellowship. Actually, the fellowship of the eternal life is the imparting of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;into the believers as their unique portion for them to enjoy today and for eternity."
BD["a18\x97"]="<b>testament</b><br> &emsp; In Greek the same word is used for both covenant and testament. A covenant is an agreement containing some promises to accomplish certain things for the covenanted people, while a testament is a will containing certain accomplished things that are bequeathed to the inheritor. The new covenant consummated with the blood of Christ is not merely a covenant but a testament in which all the things that were accomplished by the death of Christ have been bequeathed to us. First, God gave the promise that He would make a new covenant (<a href=Jer.htm#v31_31>Jer. 31:31</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v31_34>34</a>). Then Christ shed His blood to enact the covenant (<a href=Luk.htm#v22_20>Luke 22:20</a>). Since accomplished facts are promised in this covenant, it is also a testament. This testament, this will, was confirmed and validated by Christ&rsquo;s death and is being executed and enforced by Christ in His resurrection. The promise of God&rsquo;s covenant is insured by God&rsquo;s faithfulness; God&rsquo;s covenant is guaranteed by God&rsquo;s righteousness; and the testament is enforced by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection power."

BD["a/>\x97"]="<b>surety</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means a guarantee, bondsman, sponsor, and is from the root word meaning a hand into which something is placed as a pledge, implying that the guarantee, the surety, cannot be unbound. Christ is not only the consummator of the new covenant; He is also the surety, the pledge that everything in that covenant will be fulfilled. That Christ has become the surety of a better covenant is based on the fact that He is the living and perpetual High Priest."
BD["d+/\x97"]="<b>now</b><br> &emsp; In contrast to then in <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_6>v. 6</a> and referring to the present heavens and earth, which remain by the word of God (<a href=Gen.htm#v8_22>Gen. 8:22</a>) and will not be destroyed again by water, according to the covenant God made with Noah (<a href=Gen.htm#v9_11>Gen. 9:11</a>), but will be burned by fire on the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men."
BD["d+.\x9a"]="<b>flooded</b><br> &emsp; Referring to the flood of Noah&rsquo;s time (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_5>2:5</a>), which caused the earth to be destroyed (<a href=Gen.htm#v6_13>Gen. 6:13</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v6_17>17</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v9_11>9:11</a>). The earth then did not remain the same but experienced a cataclysm by being flooded with water, and was destroyed. Here Peter argued strongly with the heretical mockers. They said that &ldquo;all things continue in this way from the beginning of creation&rdquo; (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_4>v. 4</a>). But actually a cataclysm did come upon the earth because of the ungodliness of its inhabitants. This implies that the present world will not continue in the same way but will experience another cataclysm through the Lord&rsquo;s coming with His judgment upon the rebellious, including the false teachers and the heretical mockers in the apostasy."

In God&rsquo;s governmental dealing they, especially, will be kept under punishment for the day of judgment because they go after the flesh, indulging for pleasure in the lust for defilement and in corrupting luxury, and despise the Lord&rsquo;s government, rebelling against the Lord&rsquo;s authority (vv. <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_10>10</a>, <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_13>13</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_14>14</a>, <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_18>18</a>). Thus, they become persons who are like (1) animals without reason (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_12>v. 12</a>); (2) spots and blemishes among the believers, who are God&rsquo;s treasure (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_13>v. 13</a>); (3) Balaam, forsaking the straight way for unrighteous gain (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_15>v. 15</a>); (4) springs without water and mists driven by a storm (vv. <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_17>17</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_19>19</a>); and (5) dogs and sows, becoming defiled both inwardly and outwardly (vv. <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_20>20</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_22>22</a>)."

If they would not be humbled under God&rsquo;s mighty hand (<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_6>v. 6</a>) and cast their anxiety on God (<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_7>v. 7</a>), they would be devoured by the roaring lion, the devil, their adversary. This teaches us that pride and anxiety make us delicious prey to satisfy the hunger of the roaring lion. In this matter Peter no doubt could not forget the Lord&rsquo;s warning to him regarding the devil&rsquo;s desire (<a href=Luk.htm#v22_31>Luke 22:31</a>)."

We are not better than the persecutors and the haters mentioned in <a href=Psa.htm#v129>Psa. 129</a>.

BD["a5,\x97"]="<b>marriage</b><br> &emsp; In the church life, contact between brothers and sisters is unavoidable. Hence, to be protected from falling into defilement, we must hold marriage in honor and not behave loosely. This is a matter that seriously affects our birthright in God&rsquo;s economy. Reuben lost the birthright because of his defilement (<a href=Gen.htm#v49_3>Gen. 49:3</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v49_4>4</a>; <a href=1Ch.htm#v5_1>1&nbsp;Chron. 5:1</a>), and Joseph received it because of his purity (<a href=1Ch.htm#v5_1>1&nbsp;Chron. 5:1</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v39_7>Gen. 39:7</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v39_12>12</a>; see <a href=HebN.htm#n12_16x1>note 16<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v12>ch. 12</a>).

The same Greek word is used in <a href=Luk.htm#v6_33>Luke 6:33</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v6_34>34</a> and <a href=Rom.htm#v7_25>Rom. 7:25</a> for thanks. So in the next verse."

It is deeper than the purifying of our sins (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_3>Heb. 1:3</a>) and the cleansing of sin (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_7>1&nbsp;John 1:7</a>). The latter two are the purifying of our outward doing; the former is the purifying of our inward being&mdash;the soul. This purifying is like the washing of the water in the word in <a href=Eph.htm#v5_26>Eph. 5:26</a> (see <a href=EphN.htm#n5_26x3>note 3</a> there)."
