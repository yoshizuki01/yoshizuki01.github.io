BD["i=8\x9a"]="<b>length</b><br> &emsp; The dimensions of the Holy of Holies, in both the tabernacle and the temple, were equal in length, breadth, and height (<a href=Exo.htm#v26_2>Exo. 26:2</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v26_8>8</a>; <a href=1Ki.htm#v6_20>1&nbsp;Kings 6:20</a>). Hence, that the length and the breadth and the height of New Jerusalem are equal signifies that the entire New Jerusalem will be the Holy of Holies. In it, all God&rsquo;s redeemed ones will serve and worship God, will see and touch God&rsquo;s presence, and will live and dwell in God&rsquo;s presence for eternity."

Thus this book ends in a promise and a call, both of which are for eating and drinking the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit."

How perfect and complete is the wall of the holy city in God&rsquo;s eternal administration!<br> &emsp; The city proper is like a mountain with a height of twelve thousand stadia, whereas the wall itself, from the foundation to the top, has a height of a hundred and forty-four cubits."
