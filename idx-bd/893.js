BD["U3E\x99"]="<b>the</b><br> &emsp; The apostle used the expression the body instead of the body of the Lord. This may imply the fact that, in addition to the physical body of the Lord (<a href=1Co.htm#v11_24>v. 24</a>), there is the mystical Body of Christ (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_4>Eph. 4:4</a>). Therefore, when we participate in the Lord&rsquo;s table, we must discern whether the bread on the table signifies the one Body of Christ or any division of man (any denomination). In discerning the Body of Christ, we should not partake of the bread in any division or with any divisive spirit. Our participation in the Lord&rsquo;s table must be the unique fellowship of His unique Body without any division in practice or in spirit.<br> &emsp; The apostle&rsquo;s dealing with head covering concerns the Head (<a href=1Co.htm#v11_3>v. 3</a>); his dealing with the Lord&rsquo;s supper (the Lord&rsquo;s table) concerns the Body. Regarding the headship of Christ, which represents God and is represented by man, we must keep the divine governmental order ordained by God, without any disorder. Regarding the Body of Christ, we must be properly regulated by the apostle&rsquo;s instruction, without any confusion and division. The Head is Christ, and the Body is the church. Christ and the church&mdash;these two&mdash;are the controlling and directing factors of the apostle&rsquo;s dealings with the confused and disorderly church. In chs. <a href=1Co.htm#v1>1</a>&mdash;<a href=1Co.htm#v10>10</a> he dealt with the church&rsquo;s problems first by stressing Christ as God&rsquo;s center and our portion. After this, in chs. <a href=1Co.htm#v11>11</a>&mdash;<a href=1Co.htm#v16>16</a> he emphasized the church as God&rsquo;s goal and our concern. In chs. <a href=1Co.htm#v1>1</a>&mdash;<a href=1Co.htm#v10>10</a> he began with Christ as the antibiotic to heal the sick church&rsquo;s diseases. Then from <a href=1Co.htm#v11>ch. 11</a> he went on to the church and used the church, the Body, as the inoculation against the church&rsquo;s disorder. Both Christ and the church are crucial to the carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration in His New Testament economy."
