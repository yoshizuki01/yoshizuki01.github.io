What the apostle meant here is that in the church meeting, for the profit of all the attendants, we should pray with our mind in intelligible words (<a href=1Co.htm#v14_19>v. 19</a>) to express the burden in our spirit. In a church meeting our prayer not only should be heard by the Lord for His answer but also should be intelligible to all the attendants for their profit. For this purpose we should learn to use our mind in public prayer just as we use our spirit, training our mind to cooperate with our spirit, even to be one with our spirit, that the spirit may become the spirit of our mind (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_23>Eph. 4:23</a>)."
