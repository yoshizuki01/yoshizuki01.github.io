However, according to <a href=Heb.htm#v1_5>Heb. 1:5b</a>, which quotes <a href=2Sa.htm#v7_14>v. 14a</a> of this chapter, David&rsquo;s seed is actually Christ as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_5>Heb. 1:5a</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v1_6>6</a>), who has both divinity and humanity and is typified here by Solomon (see <a href=MatN.htm#n1_1x3>note 1<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v1>Matt. 1</a>). The Son of God became David&rsquo;s seed by being constituted (built) into David&rsquo;s family, i.e., into David&rsquo;s being. Here God was actually telling David that instead of building something for God, David needed God to build His Son into him. God did not want David to build Him a house of cedar (vv. <a href=2Sa.htm#v7_5>5</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v7_7>7</a>), nor was God satisfied that David would be merely a man according to His heart (<a href=1Sa.htm#v13_14>1&nbsp;Sam. 13:14</a>). God&rsquo;s desire was to work Himself in Christ into David&rsquo;s humanity to be his life, nature, and constitution. In this way Christ, the Son of God, would become everything to David, including his house (dwelling place) and his seed.<br> &emsp; <a href=2Sa.htm#v7>Second Samuel 7</a> is the unveiling of a prophecy through typology showing us that there is no need for us to build something for God. We cannot build God&rsquo;s house, the church (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>), by using ourselves or anything of ourselves as the material. The church as the house of God, the mutual abode of God and His redeemed (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_2>John 14:2</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v14_3>3</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v14_20>20</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v14_23>23</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v15_4>15:4</a>), is built with Christ as the unique element (see <a href=GenN.htm#n2_22x1>note 22<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v2>Gen. 2</a>). Thus, we need God to build Christ into our intrinsic constitution so that our entire being will be reconstituted with Christ. The building of the church is by Christ&rsquo;s making His home in our hearts, i.e., by His building Himself into us, making our heart, our intrinsic constitution, His home (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_17>Eph. 3:17</a>). The very Christ who is constituted (built) into us is God&rsquo;s house and our house, and He also becomes our seed as our heritage and our treasure."

BD["V4)\x8c"]="To boast is necessary, <I>though</I> indeed not expedient; yet I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord."
BD["U/=\x98"]="<b>but</b><br> &emsp; But here conjoins Let it not concern you and use your status as a slave rather. It means that a slave who has been called by the Lord should not care for or be troubled by his slavery, but rather should use this status, that is, remain in this status with God (<a href=1Co.htm#v7_24>v. 24</a>) for God&rsquo;s glory. Even if he is able to become free, he should remain in his status as a slave. This corresponds with the basic concept of the apostle&rsquo;s instruction, as explicitly expressed in vv. <a href=1Co.htm#v7_20>20</a> and <a href=1Co.htm#v7_24>24</a>. However, this part of the verse may be rendered as follows: &ldquo;but, even if you are able to become free, take advantage of it rather.&rdquo; The apostle&rsquo;s point in this passage is that the believers should not be influenced by their outward status. Either to remain in slavery or to have freedom is all right, as long as it is with God."
BD["Q\@2\x8c"]="Now they were Mary the Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the <I>mother</I> of James and the rest of the women with them, who told these things to the apostles."
BD["V3,\x8c"]="For if indeed he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or you receive a different spirit, which you have not received, or a different gospel, which you have not accepted, you bear well with <I>him</I>."
BD["*C7\x97"]="<b>one</b><br> &emsp; The adding of one-fifth of the valuation to redeem the house signifies that we should not take advantage of our devotion related to the church life, that we may keep the enjoyment of the church life. Otherwise, we will be churchless persons."
BD[":\x88)\x8c"]="Sing to Jehovah a new song; / Sing to Jehovah, all the earth."
BD["Q?5\x8c"]="And Pilate, calling together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,"
BD["V2/\x8c"]="You look at things according to <I>their</I> appearance. If someone has confidence in himself to be of Christ, let him take account of this again concerning himself, that even as he is of Christ, so also are we."
BD["*B:\x97"]="<b>chastise</b><br> &emsp; The chastisement on the second level is sevenfold, i.e., intensified. The sky being made like iron and the earth like bronze, yielding no produce (vv. <a href=Lev.htm#v26_19>19</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v26_20>20</a>), signifies that the Spirit will not come to us from the heavens, and we will have no spiritual produce for our spiritual food."
BD[":\x87,\x8c"]="In His hand are the depths of the earth, / The heights of the mountains are His also."
BD["Q>8\x8c"]="For I tell you that I shall by no means eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."
BD["V12\x8c"]="Now He who bountifully supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed and cause the fruits of your righteousness to increase."
BD["*A=\x97"]="<b>three</b><br> &emsp; This signifies that the sufficient grace of God surpasses our need threefold. In the Sabbath year the produce of the land, but not the possession of the land, was common for the purpose of enjoyment (vv. <a href=Lev.htm#v25_6>6</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v25_7>7</a>). For this purpose God blessed the land to produce food threefold. This practice of keeping the Sabbath year ushers God&rsquo;s people into the jubilee (vv. <a href=Lev.htm#v25_8>8</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v25_17>17</a>)."
BD[":\x86/\x8c"]="And they say, Jehovah does not see, / And the God of Jacob does not consider."
