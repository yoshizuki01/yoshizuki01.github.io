BD["i=;\x97"]="<b>foundations</b><br> &emsp; The New Jerusalem is a city of foundations (<a href=Heb.htm#v11_10>Heb. 11:10</a>). These are the twelve apostles of the Lamb (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_14>v. 14</a>), each of whom is signified by a precious stone. Peter, the first of the twelve apostles, was originally named Simon. When Simon was brought to the Lord, the Lord changed his name to Peter, meaning a stone (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_42>John 1:42</a>). Later, the Lord called him by that name when He spoke concerning the building of His church (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>). Precious stones are not created but are produced by the transforming of things created. All the apostles were created as clay, but they were regenerated and were transformed into precious stones for God&rsquo;s eternal building. Every believer needs to be thus regenerated and transformed that he may be a part of the New Jerusalem.<br> &emsp; The colors of the foundation&rsquo;s twelve precious stones, which signify the twelve apostles, are as follows: the first stone is green, the second and third are blue, the fourth is green, the fifth and sixth are red, the seventh is yellow, the eighth is bluish green, the ninth is yellow, the tenth is apple-green, the eleventh and twelfth are purple. The twelve layers of the foundation in the above colors have the appearance of a rainbow, signifying that the city is built upon and secured by God&rsquo;s faithfulness in keeping His covenant (<a href=Gen.htm#v9_8>Gen. 9:8</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v9_17>17</a>) and that the foundation of the city is trustworthy and reliable."
