BD["i:*\x97"]="<b>Fallen</b><br> &emsp; This is the fall of the material Babylon, the city of Rome, at the end of the great tribulation (see notes <a href=RevN.htm#n14_8x1>8<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v14>ch. 14</a>, <a href=RevN.htm#n16_19x2>19<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v16>ch. 16</a>, and <a href=RevN.htm#n17_5x1>5<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n17_18x1>18<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v17>ch. 17</a>). The Bible reveals three aspects of Babylon: (1) the literal aspect, referring to ancient Babel or Babylon (<a href=Gen.htm#v11_9>Gen. 11:9</a>), today&rsquo;s Iraq; (2) the religious aspect, referring to the Roman Catholic Church, spoken of in <a href=Rev.htm#v17>ch. 17</a>; and (3) the material aspect, referring to the city of Rome, mentioned in this chapter."

BD["i9-\x97"]="<b>MYSTERY</b><br> &emsp; Mystery here indicates that Babylon the Great in this chapter is not the material Babylon in <a href=Rev.htm#v18>ch. 18</a> but the religious one. The religious Babylon, the apostate church, is truly mysterious in what she is, in what she practices, and in what she teaches."
BD["i9,\x9a"]="<b>golden</b><br> &emsp; In figure, gold signifies the divine nature of God. Hence, the golden cup here indicates that in outward appearance the apostate church does have something of God. But within, her &ldquo;golden cup&rdquo; is full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication, full of idolatry, pagan practices, and satanic things in a heretical religious relationship. Therefore, although the apostate Roman Catholic Church has certain holy things, she has mixed in many evil and unclean things."

His being on the cloud corresponds with <a href=1Th.htm#v4_17>1&nbsp;Thes. 4:17</a> and indicates that at this point the Lord&rsquo;s coming back is made public in the air."
