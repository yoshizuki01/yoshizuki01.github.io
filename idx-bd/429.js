Some men are past feeling (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_19>Eph. 4:19</a> and <a href=EphN.htm#n4_19x1>note</a>), having given up the consciousness of their conscience through their denial of God (<a href=Rom.htm#v1_23>Rom. 1:23</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v1_32>32</a>). The first century heretics, such as the Sadducees in ancient Judaism (<a href=Act.htm#v23_8>Acts 23:8</a>), and the modernists in today&rsquo;s Christianity are all in this category. They have denied the Lord to the uttermost so that their conscience is seared and has lost its consciousness (<a href=1Ti.htm#v4_2>1&nbsp;Tim. 4:2</a> and <a href=1TiN.htm#n4_2x2>note 2</a>), as if they do not even have a spirit (<a href=Jud.htm#v10>Jude 10</a>, cf. <a href=Jud.htm#v19>19</a>).

After sending the prophets to Israel, God sent His Son and then sent the New Testament apostles, to bring His chosen people into a state of living Christ (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>Phil. 1:21a</a>) that they might express His divine glory with His human virtues in His holiness."

Although the kings of Judah stood on the ground of unity chosen by God and kept their belief in the Word of God, their condition did not match their standing. Most of them, like the kings of the kingdom of Israel, forsook God as the fountain of living waters and followed the idols, hewing out for themselves broken cisterns that hold no water (<a href=Jer.htm#v2_13>Jer. 2:13</a>). The kings of Judah repeatedly broke the law of God, which was given to them through Moses to govern them and keep them in the enjoyment of the God-promised good land. Eventually, God came in to take them away from the good land (<a href=2Ch.htm#v36_11>36:11</a>-<a href=2Ch.htm#v36_20>20</a>). He would not allow them to enjoy the good land that He had given them because they did not keep His law to express Him but instead expressed His enemy, the devil.<br> &emsp; In the eternal economy of God, the Father has allotted the Son, the all-inclusive Christ typified by the good land, to us as our eternal portion and has transferred us into Him that we may partake of Him (<a href=Col.htm#v1_12>Col. 1:12</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v1_13>13</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>, <a href=1Co.htm#v1_9>9</a>). We need to stand on the proper ground of the oneness of the Body of Christ (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_3>Eph. 4:3</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v4_6>6</a>) and keep the proper faith as Paul did (<a href=2Ti.htm#v4_7>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:7</a>). We also need to live and walk in Christ (<a href=Col.htm#v2_6>Col. 2:6</a>), conducting ourselves according to God to be His expression (see <a href=2ChN.htm#n16_12x1P2>note 12<sup>1</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=2Ch.htm#v16>ch. 16</a>). Then we will enjoy Christ, and the border of our enjoyment of Christ as the good land will be enlarged (<a href=1Ch.htm#v4_10>1&nbsp;Chron. 4:10</a>). If we do not conduct ourselves as God&rsquo;s expression, we will lose the enjoyment of Christ and will be carried away from Him by the enemy into &ldquo;captivity,&rdquo; as the children of Israel were (<a href=2Ch.htm#v36_6>36:6</a>, <a href=2Ch.htm#v36_20>20</a>; cf. <a href=Gal.htm#v5_1>Gal. 5:1</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v5_4>4</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v2_8>Col. 2:8</a>)."
