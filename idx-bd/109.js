BD["M++\x97"]="<b>filthy</b><br> &emsp; In type, garments signify one&rsquo;s conduct as one&rsquo;s expression (<a href=Isa.htm#v64_6>Isa. 64:6</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v19_8>Rev. 19:8</a>). That Joshua the high priest was clothed with filthy garments indicates that our conduct may still be unclean because we still live in the flesh, which is altogether filthy (<a href=Rom.htm#v7_18>Rom. 7:18</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v7_1>2&nbsp;Cor. 7:1</a>). Joshua&rsquo;s filthy garments were the basis of Satan&rsquo;s accusation."
BD["M)0\x9a"]="<b>red</b><br> &emsp; The horses of three different colors indicate that Christ&rsquo;s redemption (the red horse) leads the repentant Israel (the reddish-brown horses) to be justified and accepted by God swiftly (the white horses). This vision of the horses portrays the situation of Israel in their captivity. In the eyes of God, Christ the Redeemer was with them taking the lead, and they, God&rsquo;s redeemed people, were following Him. Because they were God&rsquo;s redeemed people, they appear at first sight as red horses. But because they were not pure, they are signified also by the reddish-brown horses (the color reddish-brown indicating a mixture). They need to contact God and to be dealt with by Him in order to gain God and be justified by Him and thus become those signified by the white horses. Once they repent, they will swiftly be accepted by God and justified by Him."

BD["M*.\x97"]="<b>spread</b><br> &emsp; The word spread indicates that God&rsquo;s scattering the people of Israel when they were taken into captivity was His spreading them for the spreading of His testimony. When the children of Israel were scattered to Babylon, four young people became witnesses of God and a testimony for Him (<a href=Dan.htm#v1_6>Dan. 1:6</a>). In this way God&rsquo;s testimony was spread to Babylon. God is great and sovereign, and He has a broad heart. Therefore, He wanted His testimony to be spread to faraway places. Cf. <a href=Act.htm#v1_8>Acts 1:8</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v8_1>8:1</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v8_4>4</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v11_19>11:19</a>."
