BD["AE*\x97"]="<b>Egypt</b><br> &emsp; In the Bible Egypt is a nation that depends not on God but on its own resources. In addition, the Egyptians exercised their wisdom to develop their natural resources in order to become rich and have a sufficient supply. When the people of Israel were short of food, they went down to Egypt (<a href=Gen.htm#v12_10>Gen. 12:10</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v42_1>42:1</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v42_3>3</a>). Thus, Egypt represents persons who, independent of God, seek worldly riches by developing their own resources to be rich in supply and to be a source of supply for others. At the time of Ezekiel, Israel turned to Egypt and leaned upon Egypt, trusting in Egypt as a staff. But the Lord said that Egypt was a staff made of reeds, easy to break (vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v29_6>6</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v29_7>7</a>)."

BD["H.0\x97"]="<b>But</b><br> &emsp; The prophets are great in their speaking concerning Christ but not in their speaking concerning other things. Micah&rsquo;s word here concerning what Jehovah requires of His people is not a matter of God&rsquo;s revelation but a matter of the prophet&rsquo;s concept (cf. <a href=PsaN.htm#n1_1x1P2>note 1<sup>1</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=Psa.htm#v1>Psa. 1</a>). The divine concept according to the divine revelation in the New Testament is that Christ has replaced the law (<a href=Rom.htm#v10_4>Rom. 10:4</a>), and God&rsquo;s people should live Christ rather than keep the law (<a href=Gal.htm#v2_19>Gal. 2:19</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>20</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v1_20>Phil. 1:20</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>21a</a>)."

Zion, which typifies the church and will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the universal divine-human incorporation of the consummated Triune God and His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite elect, is the perfection of beauty in God&rsquo;s eternal economy (cf. <a href=Eph.htm#v2_10>Eph. 2:10</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_10>Rev. 21:10</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_21>21</a>)."

BD[">FB\x97"]="<b>sevenfold</b><br> &emsp; In the consideration of the godly people, mainly the prophets, there was the expectation that the Messiah would come to restore not only the kingdom of Israel (cf. <a href=Act.htm#v1_6>Acts 1:6</a>) but also the entire universe, especially the sun, the moon, and the stars, for the growing of the living things on the earth, that the earth might be very rich in produce. In the restoration the light of the sun will be sevenfold not for scorching but for shining, for giving sunshine to grow the living things on earth. This means that the heavens will answer the earth and cause it to grow things in a rich way (<a href=Hos.htm#v2_21>Hosea 2:21</a>-<a href=Hos.htm#v2_22>22</a>). The sun&rsquo;s shining seven times brighter indicates that the produce of the earth will be seven times richer than it is in this age. At that time there will be no scarcity but rather plenitude. See notes <a href=HosN.htm#n6_11x1>11<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Hos.htm#v6>Hosea 6</a> and <a href=JoeN.htm#n3_18x1>18<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Joe.htm#v3>Joel 3</a>."
