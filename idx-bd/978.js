However, according to vv. <a href=Rev.htm#v19_8>8</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v19_9>9</a>, the wife, the bride of Christ, here consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium; whereas the bride, the wife, in <a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>21:2</a> is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity. The readiness of the bride depends on the maturity in life of the overcomers. Furthermore, the overcomers are not separate individuals but a corporate bride. For this aspect, building is needed.

BD["J*,\x97"]="<b>But</b><br> &emsp; This word, quoted three times in the New Testament by the apostle Paul (<a href=Rom.htm#v1_17>Rom. 1:17</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v3_11>Gal. 3:11</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_38>Heb. 10:38</a>), unveils God&rsquo;s eternal salvation given to sinners. According to the background of this book, both Israel (God&rsquo;s elect) and the Chaldeans (the nations) were under God&rsquo;s judgment. Under God&rsquo;s judgment all sinners, whether Jews or Gentiles, are destined to die (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_23>Rom. 6:23</a>). The unique way for sinners to escape God&rsquo;s judgment and obtain God&rsquo;s eternal salvation is to believe in God&rsquo;s embodiment, Christ, that they may become righteous and be justified in order to have life and live (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_16>John 3:16</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_18>18</a>). God&rsquo;s eternal salvation is to save our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;for eternity (<a href=1Th.htm#v5_23>1&nbsp;Thes. 5:23</a>). The way for us to receive such a salvation is to believe in Christ so that we may be justified by God and thus be qualified to have the eternal, divine life, and live by that life (<a href=Rom.htm#v3_24>Rom. 3:24</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v5_1>5:1</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v5_2>2</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v5_10>10</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v5_17>17</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_8>Eph. 2:8</a>). This is the New Testament gospel in an Old Testament prophetic book.<br> &emsp; Christ is the factor that links the books of Micah, Jonah, and Habakkuk. According to <a href=Mic.htm#v5_2>Micah 5:2</a>, Christ as the eternal One, whose origin is in eternity, has gone forth by being born as a man in Bethlehem (see <a href=MicN.htm#n5_2x1>note 2<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mic.htm#v5>Micah 5</a>). Then, the type in <a href=Jon.htm#v1_17>Jonah 1:17</a> reveals the continuation of Christ&rsquo;s going forth in His death and resurrection (see <a href=JonN.htm#n1_17x1>note 17<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Jon.htm#v1>Jonah 1</a>). In the book of Jonah, Jehovah&rsquo;s salvation was brought to Nineveh, an evil city of the Gentiles, through the preaching of the prophet. Today, God&rsquo;s salvation, which was prepared, completed, and consummated by Christ&rsquo;s going forth, has come to us through the preaching of the gospel. The way to receive and apply this salvation is by faith, as mentioned in this verse."
