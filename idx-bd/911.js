It might have been that the feeling within Jeremiah was that God&rsquo;s judgment upon Israel was too severe. After Jeremiah&rsquo;s complaining (<a href=Jer.htm#v15_10>15:10</a>), God came in to speak with Jeremiah, indicating to him that He was determined to use the Babylonians as iron to judge and punish Israel (<a href=Jer.htm#v15_12>15:12</a>). Following Jeremiah&rsquo;s experience in arguing with God, he wrote a section of his prophecy concerning Jehovah as the sovereign Potter, who has absolute right over Israel as His pottery (vv. <a href=Jer.htm#v18_1>1</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v18_10>10</a>; cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v9_20>Rom. 9:20</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v9_23>23</a>). Jehovah as the sovereign Potter is able to work with the house of Israel, as the clay in His hand, in changeable ways according to Israel&rsquo;s condition (vv. <a href=Jer.htm#v18_6>6</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v18_10>10</a>).
