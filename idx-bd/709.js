Hebron is between Beer-sheba on the south and Jerusalem on the north. Thus, Hebron was not only a place of fellowship but also a way that led to Jerusalem. In spiritual significance, the cave of Machpelah in Hebron (<a href=Gen.htm#v23_19>v. 19</a>), in which Sarah was buried, is the gateway to the New Jerusalem.<br> &emsp; The cave of Machpelah was at the end of a field, in which were many trees (<a href=Gen.htm#v23_17>v. 17</a>). A field is a place where life grows; thus, it implies resurrection. Abraham did not bury Sarah in a place of death but in a place of life, a place full of resurrection (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_36>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:36</a> and <a href=1CoN.htm#n15_36x1>note</a>). This indicates that Abraham believed in the God of resurrection (<a href=Rom.htm#v4_17>Rom. 4:17</a>) and was filled with the expectation that his wife would be resurrected and would be in the city which has the foundations, the New Jerusalem. According to Abraham&rsquo;s realization, Sarah&rsquo;s death was not a termination but an entering into the gate of resurrection, the gateway into the expected city and the better country (<a href=Heb.htm#v11_10>Heb. 11:10</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v11_16>16</a>)."
