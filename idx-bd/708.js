The narrow gate deals not only with outward conduct but also with inward motive. The old man, the self, the flesh, the human concept, and the world with its glory are all excluded; only that which corresponds with God&rsquo;s will can enter in. The kingdom people need first to enter in through such a narrow gate, and then to walk on such a constricted way. It is not that they first walk the way and then enter in through the gate. To enter in through the gate is simply to begin walking on the way, a way that is lifelong."

The fallen angels work with Satan in the air (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_2>Eph. 2:2</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v6_11>6:11</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v6_12>12</a>), and these unclean spirits, the demons, move with him on the earth. Both act evilly upon man for the kingdom of Satan. The demons&rsquo; possession of people signifies Satan&rsquo;s usurpation of man, whom God created for His purpose. The third thing the Slave-Savior, who came to destroy the works of Satan (<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_8>1&nbsp;John 3:8</a>), did as a part of His service to God was to cast out these demons from the possessed people (vv. <a href=Mrk.htm#v1_34>34</a>, <a href=Mrk.htm#v1_39>39</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v3_15>3:15</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v6_7>6:7</a>, <a href=Mrk.htm#v6_13>13</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v16_17>16:17</a>) that they might be delivered from Satan&rsquo;s bondage (<a href=Luk.htm#v13_16>Luke 13:16</a>), out of Satan&rsquo;s authority of darkness (<a href=Act.htm#v26_18>Acts 26:18</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v1_13>Col. 1:13</a>), into God&rsquo;s kingdom (<a href=Mrk.htm#v1_15>v. 15</a>).

BD["O-<\x97"]="<b>righteousness</b><br> &emsp; Righteousness here does not refer only to objective righteousness, which is the Christ whom we receive when we believe in Him and are thus justified before God (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v3_26>Rom. 3:26</a>); it refers even more to subjective righteousness, which is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness that we may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future. This subjective righteousness is obtained not by merely the fulfilling of the old law, but by the complementing of the old law through the fulfilling of the new law of the kingdom of the heavens given by the new King here in this section of the Word. This righteousness of the kingdom people, which is according to the new law of the kingdom, surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, which is according to the old law. It is impossible for our natural life to gain this surpassing righteousness; it can be produced only by a higher life, the resurrection life of Christ. This righteousness, which is likened to the wedding garment (<a href=Mat.htm#v22_11>22:11</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v22_12>12</a>), qualifies us to participate in the wedding of the Lamb (<a href=Rev.htm#v19_7>Rev. 19:7</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v19_8>8</a>) and inherit the kingdom of the heavens in its manifestation, that is, to enter into the kingdom of the heavens in the future.<br> &emsp; The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees is the righteousness of letters, which they practiced by their own life according to the old law of letters; the surpassing righteousness of the kingdom people is the righteousness of life, which they live out by taking Christ as their life according to the new law of life. Both in nature and in standard, the righteousness of life far surpasses the lifeless righteousness practiced by the scribes and Pharisees."
