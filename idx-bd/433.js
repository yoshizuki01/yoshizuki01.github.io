BD["i=4\x9a"]="<b>Israel</b><br> &emsp; Israel here represents the law of the Old Testament, indicating that the law is represented at the gates of the New Jerusalem. The law watches and observes to insure that all the communications, the comings in and goings out, of the holy city meet the law&rsquo;s requirements. That the names of the twelve tribes of Israel are inscribed on the twelve gates signifies that the twelve tribes of Israel are the entrance into the holy city; as such, they lead people, through the preaching of the gospel, into the riches of the Triune God to enjoy the supply in the city.<br> &emsp; The mentioning of Israel here also indicates that the New Jerusalem includes all the redeemed saints of the Old Testament."

BD["i=5\x97"]="<b>east</b><br> &emsp; The city lies square (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_16>v. 16</a>), with three gates on each of the four sides. The east side, at the front, toward the glory of the sunrise, ranks first; the north side, at the top, ranks second; the south side, at the bottom, ranks third; and the west side, at the rear, ranks fourth. The gates on the four sides face the four directions of the earth, signifying that the entrance into the holy city is available to all the peoples on earth. (Cf. the four heads of the river in <a href=Gen.htm#v2_10>Gen. 2:10</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_14>14</a>.) That there are three gates on each side signifies that the three of the Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;work together to bring people into the holy city. This is indicated in the three parables in <a href=Luk.htm#v15>Luke 15</a> and implied in the Lord&rsquo;s word in <a href=Mat.htm#v28_19>Matt. 28:19</a>. To be baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is the real entrance into the holy city. That there are three gates on each of the four sides, three times four being twelve, also implies that the Triune God is mingled with man, the creature. (The number four signifies the creatures&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v4_6>4:6</a>.)"
