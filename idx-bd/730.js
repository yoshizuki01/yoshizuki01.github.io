BD["G)*\x97"]="<b>Nineveh</b><br> &emsp; The capital of Assyria, located on the east bank of the Tigris River, first built by Nimrod (<a href=Gen.htm#v10_11>Gen. 10:11</a>; see <a href=GenN.htm#n1_8x1>note 8<sup>1</sup></a> there). God intended to judge Nineveh, but He also intended to extend His salvation of love to that evil Gentile city. For this reason He commissioned Jonah to go to Nineveh to cry out against the city.<br> &emsp; In his being sent by God to Nineveh, Jonah typifies Christ, who was sent by God to preach the gospel of peace to the Gentiles (<a href=Mat.htm#v12_41>Matt. 12:41</a>). Jonah was a prophet who turned from Israel to the Gentiles. In this he was a type of Christ, who turned from Israel to the Gentiles (<a href=Mat.htm#v21_43>Matt. 21:43</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v4_25>Luke 4:25</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v4_27>27</a>)."

God&rsquo;s house is the divine household (<a href=Gal.htm#v6_10>Gal. 6:10</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_19>Eph. 2:19</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>), including all the believers throughout the ages, over which Christ is the unique Steward, who takes care of God&rsquo;s household in every way. While Christ as God&rsquo;s Steward serves in God&rsquo;s house, He also governs, rules, and administrates God&rsquo;s children, who are under Christ&rsquo;s care."

BD["9R-\x97"]="<b>seen</b><br> &emsp; In the New Testament sense, seeing God equals gaining God. To gain God is to receive God in His element, in His life, and in His nature that we may be constituted with God. All God&rsquo;s redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified people will see God&rsquo;s face (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_4>Rev. 22:4</a>). Seeing God transforms us (<a href=2Co.htm#v3_18>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18</a>; cf. <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_2>1&nbsp;John 3:2</a>), because in seeing God we receive His element into us and our old element is discharged. This metabolic process is transformation (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_2>Rom. 12:2</a>). To see God is to be transformed into the glorious image of Christ, the God-man, that we may express God in His life and represent Him in His authority."
