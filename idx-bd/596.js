In the Psalms the words concerning the psalmists&rsquo; hating their enemies, their asking God to avenge them, and their cursing others are not the words of God but are words that issued from the psalmists&rsquo; natural sentiment while they were praising God. They are recorded by the Spirit of God in the Holy Scripture to serve God&rsquo;s purpose of exposing the psalmists&rsquo; spiritual condition, i.e., that although the psalmists loved God and sought Him, they were natural, not spiritual, in their sentiment."

BD["^+8\x98"]="<b>God</b><br> &emsp; This indicates that the Scripture, the word of God, is the breathing out of God. God&rsquo;s speaking is God&rsquo;s breathing out. Hence, His word is spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_63>John 6:63</a>), or breath. Thus, the Scripture is the embodiment of God as the Spirit. The Spirit is therefore the very essence, the substance, of the Scripture, just as phosphorus is the essential substance in matches. We must strike the Spirit of the Scripture with our spirit to catch the divine fire.<br> &emsp; As the embodiment of God the Spirit, the Scripture (God&rsquo;s word) is also the embodiment of Christ. Christ is God&rsquo;s living Word (<a href=Rev.htm#v19_13>Rev. 19:13</a>), and the Scripture is God&rsquo;s written word (<a href=Mat.htm#v4_4>Matt. 4:4</a>)."

On our side it is: &ldquo;Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.&rdquo; This is the issue of the divine life&mdash;it enables us to depart from unrighteousness and keeps us blameless in His holy name.

In his rebuttal there was no flavor of being enlightened in the divine revelation and no taste of being spiritual in the divine life.
