God the Father&rsquo;s selection is the initiation; God the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification carries out the selection of God the Father; and God the Son&rsquo;s redemption, signified by the sprinkling of His blood, is the completion. Through these steps the believers have been selected, sanctified, and redeemed to enter into the enjoyment of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;into whom they have been baptized (<a href=Mat.htm#v28_19>Matt. 28:19</a>) and whose virtues they are enjoying (<a href=2Co.htm#v13_14>2&nbsp;Cor. 13:14</a>)."

The divine power of the coming kingdom restores, renews, and revives the things that have become old (<a href=Mat.htm#v19_28>Matt. 19:28</a>).

BD["=)3\x97"]="<b>We</b><br> &emsp; We here indicates that in the church life the transforming of Christ&rsquo;s lover is carried out by the transforming Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God (<a href=2Co.htm#v3_18>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18</a>) with the coordination of the lover&rsquo;s companions, the gifted members in the Body of Christ who do the work of perfecting the saints (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_11>Eph. 4:11</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v4_12>12</a>). The transforming Spirit and the lover&rsquo;s companions adorn her with the constitution of the life of God (plaits of gold) by the redeeming work of Christ (studs of silver). See <a href=SoSN.htm#n1_11x2>note 11<sup>2</sup></a>.<br> &emsp; Gold refers to God the Father in His divine nature; silver, to Christ the Son in His all-inclusive judicial redemption; and strings of jewels (precious stones put together as one in strings&mdash;<a href=SoS.htm#v1_10>v. 10</a>), to God the Spirit in His transforming work (cf. <a href=1CoN.htm#n3_12x2P1>note 12<sup>2</sup>, par. 1</a>, in <a href=1Co.htm#v3>1&nbsp;Cor. 3</a>). In the proper church life the lover&rsquo;s companions, the perfected believers, coordinate with the transforming Spirit to perfect the lover by ministering the Triune God to her for her transformation by the Triune God&rsquo;s attributes being wrought into her to become her virtues. This is for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem (cf. <a href=1Co.htm#v3_12>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:12</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_18>Rev. 21:18</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_21>21</a>) for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal economy."

Since God deals with His beloved Israel in a loving way, His dealing with them, in general, is a matter not of judgment but of chastisement. God&rsquo;s dealing with the Gentiles, the nations, however, is a matter of judgment based on God&rsquo;s righteousness, on His justice.<br> &emsp; God deals with people according to what He is. God is holy and righteous; He is the Holy One and the righteous One (<a href=Isa.htm#v1_4>v. 4</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v24_16>24:16a</a>). As the Holy One, He chastises His people that they may be holy (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_10>Heb. 12:10</a>), and as the righteous One, He judges the nations because they are not just and righteous. See <a href=IsaN.htm#n26_13x1>note 13<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Isa.htm#v26>ch. 26</a>."
