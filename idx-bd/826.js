BD[")7C\x98"]="<b>twelve</b><br> &emsp; Israel&rsquo;s experience at Elim is a picture of the experience of resurrection life, which issues from the experience of the cross at Marah. At Elim there were twelve springs flowing and seventy palm trees growing. In the Bible a spring signifies life that flows out of God in resurrection into His chosen people (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_10>John 4:10</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v4_14>14</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v7_37>7:37</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v7_39>39</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>Rev. 22:1</a>), and palm trees signify life that is flourishing (<a href=Psa.htm#v92_12>Psa. 92:12</a>), rejoicing in satisfaction (<a href=Lev.htm#v23_40>Lev. 23:40</a>; <a href=Neh.htm#v8_15>Neh. 8:15</a>), and victorious over tribulation (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_13>John 12:13</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v7_9>Rev. 7:9</a>). The number twelve signifies the mingling of divinity with humanity for the complete and perfect carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration eternally (see notes <a href=RevN.htm#n21_12x2>12<sup>2</sup></a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n21_13x1>13<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v21>Rev. 21</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n22_2x4>note 2<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v22>Rev. 22</a>). Seventy equals seven times ten. The number seven signifies completion and perfection in God&rsquo;s dispensational move (see <a href=RevN.htm#n2_29x1>note 29<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v2>Rev. 2</a>), and the number ten signifies fullness (see <a href=RevN.htm#n2_10x2>note 10<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v2>Rev. 2</a>). Hence, the number seventy signifies completion and perfection temporally for God&rsquo;s dispensational move in full. Thus, the twelve springs at Elim signify God as living water flowing into His chosen people to be mingled with them for the accomplishing of His eternal administration, and the seventy palm trees signify God as life growing in His people to carry out His administration dispensationally to express the riches of the divine life and its victory.<br> &emsp; When used together, the numbers twelve and seventy signify that God&rsquo;s people are to carry out His ministry (<a href=Exo.htm#v24_1>24:1</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v24_4>4</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v9_1>Luke 9:1</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v10_1>10:1</a>) by the flowing life signified by the twelve springs and the growing life signified by the seventy palm trees."

BD["S*=\x99"]="<b>saved</b><br> &emsp; This is the conclusion of the quotation of Joel&rsquo;s prophecy, which began in <a href=Act.htm#v2_17>v. 17</a>, indicating that the issue of God&rsquo;s pouring out of His Spirit upon all flesh is their salvation through calling on the name of the Lord. God&rsquo;s outpouring of His Spirit is the applying of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation to His chosen people. To be saved is to receive this Spirit, who is the blessing of the gospel in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_2>Gal. 3:2</a>, <a href=Gal.htm#v3_5>5</a>, <a href=Gal.htm#v3_14>14</a>). This Spirit is the Lord Himself as the breath (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_22>John 20:22</a>) and the living water (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_10>John 4:10</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v4_14>14</a>) to us. To breathe Him in as our breath and drink Him as our living water, we need to call on Him. <a href=Lam.htm#v3_55>Lamentations 3:55</a>-<a href=Lam.htm#v3_56>56</a> indicates that our calling on the Lord is our breathing, and <a href=Isa.htm#v12_3>Isa. 12:3</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v12_4>4</a> indicates that our calling on the Lord is our drinking. After we believe in the Lord, we need to call on Him that we may not only be saved but also enjoy His riches (<a href=Rom.htm#v10_12>Rom. 10:12</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v10_13>13</a>). When we exercise our spirit to call on Him, breathe Him in, and drink Him, we enjoy His riches; this is the real worship to God. The Lord connected such worship (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_24>John 4:24</a>) to the drinking of the living water given by Him (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_14>John 4:14</a>)."
