This verse shows that Satan&rsquo;s deceiving of the nations that are in the four corners of the earth is his deceiving of Gog and Magog. This may indicate that in mankind&rsquo;s last rebellion against God, which will be instigated by Satan, Gog and Magog will take the lead and the nations will follow."

BD["i>*\x97"]="<b>tree</b><br> &emsp; That the one tree of life grows on the two sides of the river signifies that the tree of life is a vine that spreads and proceeds along the flow of the water of life for God&rsquo;s people to receive and enjoy. This tree fulfills for eternity what God intended from the beginning (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>Gen. 2:9</a>). The tree of life was closed to man because of his fall (<a href=Gen.htm#v3_22>Gen. 3:22</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v3_24>24</a>), but it was opened to the believers through the redemption of Christ (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_19>Heb. 10:19</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_20>20</a>). Today the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life is the believers&rsquo; common portion (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_35>John 6:35</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v6_57>57</a>). In the millennial kingdom the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life will be a dispensational reward to the overcoming believers (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_7>2:7</a>). Eventually, in the new heaven and new earth for eternity, the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life will be the eternal portion of all God&rsquo;s redeemed (vv. <a href=Rev.htm#v22_14>14</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_19>19</a>). Christ as the tree of life is the life supply available along the flow of the Spirit as the water of life. Where the Spirit flows, there the life supply of Christ is found. This is all in and with the divine nature as our holy way, signified by the street. This is the supply of the holy city, and this is the way the city is supplied."
