BD["i22\x97"]="<b>devoured</b><br> &emsp; The writer of this book not only received but also devoured the scroll. To devour anything is to receive it into one&rsquo;s being. We must receive the divine revelation, especially the book of Revelation, in this way. Both Jeremiah and Ezekiel did this (<a href=Jer.htm#v15_16>Jer. 15:16</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v2_8>Ezek. 2:8</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v3_3>3</a>)."
BD["95<)o18"]="<b>3.</b>&nbsp; Job's arguments with God"
BD["i4,\x97"]="<b>stars</b><br> &emsp; The stars of heaven here signify the angels (<a href=Job.htm#v38_7>Job 38:7</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v14_12>Isa. 14:12</a>). The third part of the stars of heaven must be the fallen angels, who followed Satan in his rebellion against God. Satan drags all of them away, and as the angels of Satan they will be cast to the earth with Satan (<a href=Rev.htm#v12_9>v. 9</a>). Hence, at that time the earth will be filled with these fallen angels, who will damage the dwelling place of the people who rebel against God. The earth will thus become a dreadful place."
BD["i15\x97"]="<b>golden</b><br> &emsp; The blood of expiation was put on the four horns of the golden altar, the incense altar, for expiation (<a href=Exo.htm#v30_10>Exo. 30:10</a>), i.e., for redemption. The voice that comes out of the four horns of the golden altar indicates that God&rsquo;s judgment on man is based on the redemption of Christ; i.e., it comes because men do not believe in Christ&rsquo;s redemption."
