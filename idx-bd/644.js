BD["O90\x97"]="<b>no</b><br> &emsp; Peter proposed to keep Moses and Elijah, i.e., the law and the prophets, with Christ, but God took Moses and Elijah away, leaving no one except Jesus Himself. The law and the prophets were shadows and prophecies, not the reality; the reality is Christ. Now that Christ, the reality, is here, the shadows and prophecies are no longer needed. No one except Jesus Himself should remain in the New Testament. Jesus is today&rsquo;s Moses; as such, He imparts the law of life into His believers. Jesus is also today&rsquo;s Elijah; as such, He speaks for God and speaks forth God within His believers. This is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy."
BD["T,*\x97"]="<b>works</b><br> &emsp; This refers to Abraham&rsquo;s doing something for God by himself, as seen in his attempts to have God accept the fruit of his efforts (first Lot, then Eliezer, then Ishmael, who was born through Hagar) as God&rsquo;s promised seed. The result of Abraham&rsquo;s being justified, however, was that he eventually stopped his own work for God. This was signified by circumcision (<a href=Rom.htm#v4_11>v. 11</a>), which is the cutting off of the flesh. Hence, circumcision became God&rsquo;s constant reminder to Abraham to stop his own doing and live by faith in God. Justification has nothing to do with the works and accomplishments of the flesh."

BD["O69\x97"]="<b>loaves</b><br> &emsp; <a href=Joh.htm#v6_9>John 6:9</a> tells us that these five loaves were barley loaves. Barley is a type of the resurrected Christ (<a href=Lev.htm#v23_10>Lev. 23:10</a>). Thus, the barley loaves signify Christ in resurrection as food to us. Loaves are of the vegetable life, signifying the generating aspect of Christ&rsquo;s life, whereas fish are of the animal life, signifying the redeeming aspect of Christ&rsquo;s life. For our spiritual hunger to be satisfied, we need Christ&rsquo;s generating life as well as His redeeming life. Both aspects are symbolized by small items&mdash;loaves and fish. This indicates that in this age the heavenly King came to His followers not as a great King to reign over them but as small pieces of food to feed them.
