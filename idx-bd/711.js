This cup is the new covenant, comprising all the rich blessings of the New Testament, including God Himself. The new covenant was established by the Lord&rsquo;s blood, which He shed on the cross for our redemption (<a href=Mat.htm#v26_28>Matt. 26:28</a>)."

BD[":\x8c)\x97"]="<b>Make</b><br> &emsp; This psalm opens with a charge given to all the earth to make a joyful noise to Jehovah as Christ, the reigning One."
BD["[))\x97"]="<b>church</b><br> &emsp; This Epistle and 2&nbsp;Thessalonians were addressed to the local church in Thessalonica, composed of all the believers in Christ in that city. Such a local church is of the believers and is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. This indicates that a local church is born of God the Father with His life and nature and is united with the Lord Jesus Christ organically in all that He is and has done. Hence, it is of men (such as the Thessalonians), yet is in God and in the Lord organically. This organic union in the divine life and nature is the vital base for the believers to live a holy life for the church life. Such a living is the theme of the two Epistles."
BD["X,;\x97"]="<b>being</b><br> &emsp; Feeling here refers mainly to the consciousness of one&rsquo;s conscience. Hence, being past feeling means not caring for one&rsquo;s conscience. After man fell, God ordained that man should be under the ruling of his conscience. But instead of regarding his conscience, fallen man gave himself over to lasciviousness and greedy lust."
BD["R3\\\x97"]="<b>gather</b><br> &emsp; The phrase gather into one the children of God mentioned in this chapter implies that not only the Lord&rsquo;s death but also the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life are for the building up of God&rsquo;s children. By His death the Lord released His life so that it could be imparted into those who believe into Him. This life is experienced by us in His resurrection. It is in the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection that we grow together into one by His life to become His Body."

BD["Y,2\x97"]="<b>blossom</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means to sprout and bloom, implying that the Philippian believers&rsquo; thinking toward the apostle was a matter of life. For some time their thinking for Paul had been dormant. But when Paul wrote this Epistle, their thinking for him had begun to blossom anew, just like a plant&rsquo;s sprouting and blooming."
BD["Y,0\x9d"]="<b>virtue</b><br> &emsp; Meaning excellence, that is, ethical energy exhibited in vigorous action. See notes <a href=2PeN.htm#n1_3x11>3<sup>11</sup></a> and <a href=2PeN.htm#n1_5x4>5<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=2Pe.htm#v1>2&nbsp;Pet. 1</a>."
BD["P6e\x97"]="<b>Blessed</b><br> &emsp; The befuddled high priest of the traditional, God-forsaking and God-forsaken religion called God &ldquo;the Blessed&rdquo; in order to show how much he revered and honored God."
BD["S2V\x97"]="<b>speaking</b><br> &emsp; Speaking in tongues was not the unique issue of receiving the Holy Spirit economically, because in this case the magnifying, that is, the praising, of God was also one of its issues, as was prophesying in the case of the twelve believers in Ephesus (<a href=Act.htm#v19_6>19:6</a>). Hence, speaking in tongues is not the only evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit economically; neither is it the necessary evidence, because there is at least one case of the receiving of the Holy Spirit economically, the case of the Samaritan believers (<a href=Act.htm#v8_15>8:15</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v8_17>17</a>), which does not mention speaking in tongues. In the case of Saul of Tarsus (<a href=Act.htm#v9_17>9:17</a>) concerning this matter, there again is no mention of speaking in tongues, although he told us later, in <a href=1Co.htm#v14_18>1&nbsp;Cor. 14:18</a>, that he spoke in tongues."
BD["Y+5\x97"]="<b>not</b><br> &emsp; Paul had experienced and gained Christ tremendously, yet he did not account of himself to have experienced Christ in full or gained Him to the uttermost. He still endeavored to pursue toward the goal&mdash;the gaining of Christ to the fullest extent."
BD["Y*8\x97"]="<b>Holding</b><br> &emsp; Lit., applying, presenting, offering. To hold forth the word of life is to apply it, to present it, and to offer it to the world by living out Christ."

BD["Y);\x97"]="<b>salvation</b><br> &emsp; The same Greek word as in <a href=Phi.htm#v2_12>2:12</a>. The salvation here is the working out of the salvation in <a href=Phi.htm#v2_12>2:12</a>; it means to be sustained and strengthened to live and magnify Christ (see <a href=PhiN.htm#n2_12x4>note 12<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=Phi.htm#v2>ch. 2</a>). This requires the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ."
BD["X.4\x9a"]="<b>heavenlies</b><br> &emsp; Heavenlies here refers to the air (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_2>2:2</a>). Satan and his spiritual forces of evil are in the air. But we are seated in the third heaven above them (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_6>2:6</a>). In fighting a battle, the position above the enemy is very important strategically. Satan and his evil forces are under us, and they are destined to be defeated by us."

BD["X+=\x9a"]="<b>Christ</b><br> &emsp; In the church the sphere of God&rsquo;s glorification is narrow, being limited to the household of the faith. But in Christ the sphere is much broader because Christ is the Head of all the families in the heavens and on earth (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_22>1:22</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v3_15>3:15</a>). Hence, God&rsquo;s glorification in Christ is in the realm of all the families created by God, not only on earth but also in the heavens. This is in accord with unto all the generations forever and ever, which means for eternity."

These riches become the element and substance with which we grow and are built up. To be rooted is for the growth in life. This rooting has been completed already. To be built up is for the building of the Body of Christ. This is still going on. Both these matters are in Christ."
BD["W-A\x97"]="<b>live</b><br> &emsp; To live by the Spirit is to have our life dependent on and regulated by the Spirit, not by the law. This equals the walk by the Spirit in <a href=Gal.htm#v5_16>v. 16</a> but differs from the walk by the Spirit in this verse (see <a href=GalN.htm#n5_25x2>note 2</a>)."

In this continuation the Man-Savior charged the Jews that while they were still on the way (were going), under the law (their opponent&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v5_45>John 5:45</a>), to meet God (the magistrate) and be judged by Christ (the judge&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v5_22>John 5:22</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v17_31>Acts 17:31</a>), they should endeavor to be released from their opponent that they might not be judged by Christ and thrown into the lake of fire (prison&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v20_11>Rev. 20:11</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_15>15</a>) by the angel (the officer&mdash;cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v13_41>Matt. 13:41</a>). If that were to happen, they would by no means come out forever (<a href=Luk.htm#v12_59>v. 59</a>). The word in these two verses was spoken to the crowds (<a href=Luk.htm#v12_54>v. 54</a>) that they might repent and be saved. But in <a href=Mat.htm#v5_25>Matt. 5:25</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v5_26>26</a> this word was applied to the disciples that they might live the kingdom life (see <a href=MatN.htm#n5_25x1>notes</a> there)."
