The Holy Spirit today is a guarantee, a foretaste, and a sample of our divine inheritance, until our body is transfigured in glory, at which time we will inherit God in full.

By His passing through death and entering into resurrection, His humanity was uplifted into His divinity. Thus, in His divinity with His humanity that passed through death and resurrection, He was born in resurrection as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son (<a href=Act.htm#v13_33>Acts 13:33</a>). At the same time, all His believers were raised together with Him in His resurrection (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:3</a>) and were begotten together with Him as the many sons of God.

His being the firstborn Son of God, having both divinity and humanity, began with His resurrection.

They are exactly like Him in life and nature, and, like Him, they have both humanity and divinity. They are His increase and expression in order that they may express the eternal Triune God for eternity. The church today is a miniature of this expression (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>Eph. 1:23</a>), and the New Jerusalem in eternity will be the ultimate manifestation of this expression (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_11>Rev. 21:11</a>). This book reveals that God&rsquo;s making sinners His sons is for this expression (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_5>12:5</a>) and points to the ultimate manifestation of this expression (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_19>Eph. 3:19</a>)."

Then, according to the Lord&rsquo;s word they cast the net, and they caught an abundance of fish. But without these fish, and even on land, where there were no fish, the Lord prepared fish and even bread for the disciples. This too was a miracle! By this the Lord trained them to realize that without His leading, even if they should go to the sea, where the fish were, at night, the right time for fishing, they would catch nothing; but if they followed the Lord&rsquo;s leading, even on land, where there were no fish, the Lord could provide fish for them. Though they caught many fish according to the Lord&rsquo;s word, the Lord would not use these fish to feed them. This was a real lesson to Peter.

Lightning may be considered as being concealed in a cloud, waiting for an opportunity to flash forth. In a similar way, Christ will be clothed with a cloud (<a href=Rev.htm#v10_1>Rev. 10:1</a>) in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear, like a flash of lightning striking the earth. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s coming like a flash of lightning will be a sign of the end of the Lord&rsquo;s parousia (see <a href=MatN.htm#n24_3x3>note 3<sup>3</sup></a>). This implies also that the Lord is like electricity."
