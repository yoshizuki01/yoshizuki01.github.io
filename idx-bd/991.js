The work of God&rsquo;s re-creation was to recover the land by restricting the result of the waters of judgment (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_9>Gen. 1:9</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v1_10>10</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v5_22>Jer. 5:22</a>).

Since the work of God&rsquo;s re-creation, God&rsquo;s intention has been to abolish the sea by dealing with Satan and his demons. Hence, the sea is no more indicates that Satan and his evil followers will all be dealt with and will not be found in the new heaven and new earth."
