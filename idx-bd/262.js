Immediately after Christ&rsquo;s ascension, these four things&mdash;the gospel, war, famine, and death&mdash;began to run like riders on four horses, and they will continue until Christ comes back.

The beginning of human government was at Babel (Babylon), which was built by Nimrod (<a href=Gen.htm#v10_8>Gen. 10:8</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v10_10>10</a>), and the ending of human government will be the revived Roman Empire under Antichrist.

Under Antichrist, the last Caesar, the Roman Empire will be both political and religious Babylon (<a href=Rev.htm#v17>Rev. 17</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v18>18</a>). The empire of Antichrist will be the political and physical Babylon, i.e., &ldquo;Babylon the Great&rdquo; (<a href=Rev.htm#v18_2>Rev. 18:2</a>), whereas the Roman Catholic Church, called &ldquo;MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT&rdquo; (<a href=Rev.htm#v17_5>Rev. 17:5</a>), will be the religious Babylon.
