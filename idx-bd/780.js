The children of Israel were God&rsquo;s elect, separated from the nations unto God (<a href=Exo.htm#v19_6>Exo. 19:6</a>), God&rsquo;s vine for the accomplishing of His economy (<a href=Ezk.htm#v15_1>15:1</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v15_8>8</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v19_10>19:10</a>), God&rsquo;s bride for His satisfaction (<a href=Ezk.htm#v16_8>16:8</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v23_4>23:4</a>), God&rsquo;s flock under His care (<a href=Ezk.htm#v34>ch. 34</a>), and God&rsquo;s precious and personal treasure (<a href=Exo.htm#v19_5>Exo. 19:5</a>). However, in contrast with these five statuses, in their degradation they became rebels against God (<a href=Ezk.htm#v2_3>v. 3</a>), thistles and thorns (<a href=Ezk.htm#v2_6>v. 6</a>), a harlot (<a href=Ezk.htm#v6_9>6:9</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v16_15>16:15</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v23_30>23:30</a>), scorpions (<a href=Ezk.htm#v2_6>v. 6</a>), and dross (<a href=Ezk.htm#v22_18>22:18</a>). The causes of Israel&rsquo;s degradation were (1) their having idols in their hearts (<a href=Ezk.htm#v14_3>14:3</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v14_5>5</a>), (2) their being associated with the world, i.e., the heathen nations (<a href=Ezk.htm#v25_8>25:8</a>; cf. <a href=1Ki.htm#v11_1>1&nbsp;Kings 11:1</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v11_2>2</a>; <a href=1Ki.htm#v16_30>16:30</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v16_31>31</a>), and (3) their walking according to the manner and customs of the nations (<a href=Ezk.htm#v11_12>11:12</a>). These are also the main causes of the degradation of God&rsquo;s New Testament elect, the church (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_4>Rev. 2:4</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v2_12>12</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v2_15>15</a>).<br> &emsp; God&rsquo;s judgment on His people, as seen in chs. <a href=Ezk.htm#v2>2</a>&mdash;<a href=Ezk.htm#v24>24</a>, is based on His righteousness, holiness, and glory. God&rsquo;s glory is versus idols (<a href=Ezk.htm#v8_2>8:2</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v8_4>4</a>, <a href=Ezk.htm#v8_10>10</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v9_3>9:3</a>), God&rsquo;s holiness is versus dross (<a href=Ezk.htm#v22_17>22:17</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v22_22>22</a>), and God&rsquo;s righteousness is versus Israel&rsquo;s injustice and oppression (<a href=Ezk.htm#v22_29>22:29</a>). Anything that does not match God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness will provoke God&rsquo;s judgment. As seen in this book and in the New Testament, God first judges His people, and then He judges the nations (chs. <a href=Ezk.htm#v25>25</a>&mdash;<a href=Ezk.htm#v32>32</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v4_17>1&nbsp;Pet. 4:17</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v2>Rev. 2</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v3>3</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v2_6>6</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v11>11</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v2_15>15</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v19>19</a>)."

To be righteous, i.e., to be right with persons, matters, and things before God according to His righteous and strict requirements, we need to be revived and transformed in our soul in order to be proper and balanced in our mind, emotion, and will."

To deride is to make fun of or laugh at in contempt. To sneer is to smile or laugh with facial expressions that show scorn or contempt. When Christ was on the cross, the ridiculers also shook, or wagged, their heads in scorn. To mock is to hold up to scorn or contempt and to imitate or mimic in derision. All these things were suffered by the Lord Jesus Christ while He was nailed on the cross."

However, the Babylonians would harvest the &ldquo;grapes&rdquo; from the &ldquo;vine&rdquo; of Israel, and then come again to glean the vine thoroughly.
