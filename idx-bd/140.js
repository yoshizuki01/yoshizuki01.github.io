BD["[-,)o19"]="<b>2.</b>&nbsp; The safeguard of faith, love, and hope"
BD["[+.\x97"]="<b>to</b><br> &emsp; The apostle was in Corinth after leaving Athens (<a href=Act.htm#v17_15>Acts 17:15</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v17_16>16</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v18_1>18:1</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v18_5>5</a>). It was in Corinth that he wrote this lovely letter to the dear saints in Thessalonica for their encouragement."
BD["OCR\x97"]="<b>cannot</b><br> &emsp; If He had saved Himself, He could not save us."
BD["X.\@\x97"]="<b>Grace</b><br> &emsp; Grace is needed for us to live a church life that fulfills God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and solves God&rsquo;s problem with His enemy."
BD["Y)F\x97"]="<b>me</b><br> &emsp; Paul was a pattern set up by God&rsquo;s grace for His New Testament economy (<a href=1Ti.htm#v1_14>1&nbsp;Tim. 1:14</a>-<a href=1Ti.htm#v1_16>16</a>). The New Testament believers should experience and enjoy Christ by living and magnifying Him as Paul did in his sufferings for Christ, that they may be fellow partakers with Paul of grace."
BD["X-C\x97"]="<b>present</b><br> &emsp; In the past, Christ as the Redeemer gave Himself up for the church (<a href=Eph.htm#v5_25>v. 25</a>) for redemption and the impartation of life (<a href=Joh.htm#v19_34>John 19:34</a>); in the present, He as the life-giving Spirit is sanctifying the church through separation, saturation, transformation, growth, and building up; and in the future, He as the Bridegroom will present the church to Himself as His counterpart for His satisfaction. Therefore, Christ&rsquo;s loving the church is to separate and sanctify her, and His separating and sanctifying the church are to present her to Himself."
BD["X-B\x9a"]="<b>word</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word denotes an instant word. The indwelling Christ as the life-giving Spirit is always speaking an instant, present, living word to metabolically cleanse away the old and replace it with the new, causing an inward transformation. The cleansing by the washing of the water of life is in the word of Christ. This indicates that in the word of Christ there is the water of life. This is typified by the laver situated between the altar and the tabernacle (<a href=Exo.htm#v38_8>Exo. 38:8</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v40_7>40:7</a>)."
BD["X,F\x97"]="<b>grieve</b><br> &emsp; To grieve the Holy Spirit is to displease Him. The Holy Spirit abides in us forever (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_16>John 14:16</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v14_17>17</a>), never leaving us. Hence, He is grieved when we do not walk according to Him (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_4>Rom. 8:4</a>), that is, when we do not live according to the principle of reality with grace in the details of our daily walk."
BD["O\@[\x97"]="<b>cut</b><br> &emsp; Referring to being cut off from the glorious Christ, from the glory of His kingdom, and from His glorious presence in His kingdom, unable to participate in Christ and the glory of His kingdom in the manifestation of the kingdom, which the faithful slaves will enjoy (<a href=Mat.htm#v24_45>v. 45</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v25_21>25:21</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v25_23>23</a>). This corresponds with cast out&hellip;into the outer darkness in the conclusion of the parable of the talents (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_14>25:14</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v25_30>30</a>), which completes this section, vv. <a href=Mat.htm#v24_45>45</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v24_51>51</a>."
BD["Z,4\x97"]="<b>stand</b><br> &emsp; In the Greek, stand here is in the passive voice. Hence, it implies being placed, being presented, and corresponds with present in <a href=Col.htm#v1_28>1:28</a>."
BD["Q\@I\x97"]="<b>Jerusalem</b><br> &emsp; Jerusalem was the place where the resurrected Savior wanted His disciples to remain before the day of Pentecost (<a href=Luk.htm#v24_49>v. 49</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v1_4>Acts 1:4</a>)."
BD["Z+7\x97"]="<b>peace</b><br> &emsp; The peace of Christ is Christ Himself. By this peace Christ has made the two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles, one new man, and this peace has become a part of the gospel (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_14>Eph. 2:14</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_18>18</a>). We should let this peace arbitrate in our hearts for the Body life."
BD["U8=\x97"]="<b>The</b><br> &emsp; Verses <a href=1Co.htm#v16_10>10</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v16_21>21</a> present a picture of the actual practice of the Body life in a beautiful harmony, not only among the apostle and his co-workers but also between them and the churches for the building up of the Body, which is so strongly stressed in chs. <a href=1Co.htm#v12>12</a>&mdash;<a href=1Co.htm#v14>14</a>."
BD["SA4\x97"]="<b>council</b><br> &emsp; The council of a Roman province, composed of the councilors or assessors chosen by the governor of the province, with whom the governor usually consulted concerning an appeal like Paul&rsquo;s."
BD["R;O\x97"]="<b>pounds</b><br> &emsp; See <a href=JohN.htm#n12_3x1>note 3<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Joh.htm#v12>ch. 12</a>."
BD["V3C\x97"]="<b>watchings</b><br> &emsp; See <a href=2CoN.htm#n6_5x1>note 5<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=2Co.htm#v6>ch. 6</a>."

BD["Z*:\x97"]="<b>defraud</b><br> &emsp; The heretical teachers judged the saints unworthy to worship God directly and maintained that they had to approach Him through the mediation of angels. This was to defraud the saints of their prize, depriving them of the enjoyment of Christ. In Christ, our sole Mediator, we can worship God directly."
BD["U7\@\x97"]="<b>end</b><br> &emsp; In the preceding verse the order of resurrection is mentioned: the first, Christ; then those who are Christ&rsquo;s. Accordingly, in this verse, after then, one would expect a group of people to be named. However, here it does not tell us who, but it says &ldquo;the end,&rdquo; because those who will be resurrected at the end in their own order are not in Christ.<br> &emsp; The end here is the end of all the ages and dispensations of the old creation. It is also the end of the millennium before the new heaven and new earth (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_1>Rev. 21:1</a>). In all the ages and dispensations God, on one hand, has been dealing with His enemy Satan and all the negative things in the universe; on the other hand, He has been accomplishing all things for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. The last of the ages and dispensations will be the millennium, the kingdom age, after which all God&rsquo;s dealings and accomplishments will be fully completed. That completion will be the end, the conclusion, of all God&rsquo;s work. At this end all the dead unbelievers, the unrighteous, will be resurrected unto judgment for eternal perdition (<a href=Joh.htm#v5_29>John 5:29</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v20_5>Rev. 20:5</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_11>11</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_15>15</a>). They will be third in order in the resurrection."
BD["S\@7\x97"]="<b>resurrection</b><br> &emsp; The resurrection of the righteous will occur before the millennium at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_23>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:23</a>; <a href=1Th.htm#v4_16>1&nbsp;Thes. 4:16</a>). This will be the resurrection of life (<a href=Joh.htm#v5_28>John 5:28</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v5_29>29a</a> and <a href=JohN.htm#n5_28x1>notes</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v12_2>Dan. 12:2a</a>) and the resurrection of reward (<a href=Luk.htm#v14_14>Luke 14:14</a>), which includes the first, or the best, resurrection (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>Rev. 20:4</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a> and notes <a href=RevN.htm#n20_5x2>5<sup>2</sup></a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n20_6x2>6<sup>2</sup></a>), the out-resurrection (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_11>Phil. 3:11</a> and <a href=PhiN.htm#n3_11x2>note 2</a>). The resurrection of the unrighteous will occur after the millennium (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_5>Rev. 20:5</a>). This will be the resurrection of judgment (<a href=Joh.htm#v5_29>John 5:29b</a> and <a href=JohN.htm#n5_29x1>notes</a>) and of shame and everlasting contempt (<a href=Dan.htm#v12_2>Dan. 12:2b</a>), and will be for the judgment of eternal perdition upon the unrighteous (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_12>Rev. 20:12</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_15>15</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n20_12x1>note 12<sup>1</sup></a>). It was concerning this judgment that the apostle warned the unrighteous Felix in <a href=Act.htm#v24_25>v. 25</a> (see <a href=ActN.htm#n24_25x2>note 2</a> there)."
BD["S5X\x97"]="<b>appointed</b><br> &emsp; Or, ordained. One&rsquo;s rejecting the gospel is evidence that he is unworthy of eternal life (<a href=Act.htm#v13_46>v. 46</a>); one&rsquo;s believing it is proof that he was appointed or ordained by God to eternal life. God&rsquo;s ordination, or predestination, for man&rsquo;s salvation is sovereignly of Himself. However, He still leaves man to his own free will. Whether man would believe or reject His salvation is up to man&rsquo;s own decision."
BD["Z)=\x97"]="<b>enemies</b><br> &emsp; Because we were sinners, we needed redemption. Because we were also enemies of God, we needed reconciliation."
BD["Z)<\x9a"]="<b>having</b><br> &emsp; To reconcile all things to Himself is to make peace with Himself for all things. This was accomplished through the blood of the cross of Christ."
BD[":=>*oHangTree"]="<b>g.</b>&nbsp; The hanging of a criminal on a tree"
BD["\\)+\x97"]="<b>faith</b><br> &emsp; See <a href=1ThN.htm#n1_3x2>note 3<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=1Th.htm#v1>1&nbsp;Thes. 1</a>. In the first Epistle to the Thessalonians, faith and love were considered constructing elements of the believers&rsquo; life for the church. Here, in this Epistle, faith and love are growing and increasing in the Thessalonians&rsquo; Christian life."
BD["S=\@\x97"]="<b>purified</b><br> &emsp; To be purified with the Nazarites was to become a Nazarite with them, joining them in the fulfilling of their vow. The same word is used in the Septuagint in <a href=Num.htm#v6_3>Num. 6:3</a> in describing the Nazarite&rsquo;s duties. To take the Nazarite vow was a purification before God."
BD["[,+\x97"]="<b>sanctification</b><br> &emsp; See <a href=RomN.htm#n6_19x2>note 19<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Rom.htm#v6>Rom. 6</a>. God&rsquo;s will is that His redeemed people, the believers in Christ, live a life of holiness according to His holy nature, a life wholly separated unto Him from anything other than Him. For this He is sanctifying us wholly (<a href=1Th.htm#v5_23>5:23</a>)."
