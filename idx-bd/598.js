BD["f))\x99"]="<b>truthfulness</b><br> &emsp; The same as the Greek word for truth. According to John&rsquo;s usage of this word, especially in his Gospel, here it denotes the revealed divine reality&mdash;the Triune God dispensed into man in the Son, Jesus Christ&mdash;becoming man&rsquo;s genuineness and sincerity, that man may live a life that corresponds with the divine light (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_19>John 3:19</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_21>21</a>) and worship God, as God seeks, according to what He is (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_23>John 4:23</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v4_24>24</a>). This is the virtue of God (<a href=Rom.htm#v3_7>Rom. 3:7</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v15_8>15:8</a>) becoming our virtue, by which we love the believers (see <a href=1JoN.htm#n1_6x6P8>note 6<sup>6</sup>, point 7</a>, in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1>1&nbsp;John 1</a>). In such genuineness the apostle John, who lived in the divine reality of the Trinity, loved the one to whom he wrote."

BD["A))\x98"]="<b>river</b><br> &emsp; A river in Babylon that flows east of the Euphrates and eventually empties into it. Chebar means strong, powerful. The river Chebar symbolizes the power of Babylon to damage God&rsquo;s people (cf. <a href=Isa.htm#v8_7>Isa. 8:7</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v8_8>8</a>). It signifies the tide of the present age, which carries people away from God to Babylon. There are two rivers in the book of Ezekiel: the river Chebar in <a href=Ezk.htm#v1>ch. 1</a> and the river flowing out of the temple in <a href=Ezk.htm#v47>ch. 47</a>. The former carries the people of God away from God and destroys the building of God; the latter brings people into God&rsquo;s life and builds up God&rsquo;s dwelling place (cf. <a href=GenN.htm#n2_12x1>note 12<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v2>Gen. 2</a>)."

When the believers suffer persecution in their body, especially as in martyrdom, they should commit their souls as a deposit to God, the faithful Creator, as the Lord committed His spirit to the Father (<a href=Luk.htm#v23_46>Luke 23:46</a>)."
BD["c*A\x99"]="<b>souls</b><br> &emsp; Our soul is our inner being, our real person. Our Lord, as the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls, shepherds us by caring for the welfare of our inner being and by exercising His oversight over the condition of our real person."

BD["d+5\x99"]="<b>righteousness</b><br> &emsp; Righteousness is the main factor based on which God&rsquo;s governmental judgment is meted out to all creatures in His old creation. Hence, in these two books concerning God&rsquo;s government, this matter is stressed repeatedly (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_23>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:23</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_24>24</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v3_12>3:12</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v3_14>14</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v4_18>4:18</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v1_1>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:1</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_5>2:5</a>, <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_7>7</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_8>8</a>, <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_21>21</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_13>3:13</a>). The main matter seen in John&rsquo;s writings is the love of God expressed in His life; in Paul&rsquo;s writings, the grace of God distributed in His economy; and in Peter&rsquo;s writings, the righteousness of God maintained in His government. God&rsquo;s life, economy, and government are the basic structures of the ministry of the three apostles. Life is of love, economy is through grace, and government is based on righteousness. This righteousness will dwell in the new heavens and new earth, saturating God&rsquo;s new universe prevailingly and thus maintaining it absolutely under God&rsquo;s righteous order, so that no further judgment will ever be needed."
BD["9>6\x8c"]="Thick clouds are a covering to Him, so He cannot see; / And He walks upon the circle of the heavens."
BD[":\xad)\x99"]="<b>unity</b><br> &emsp; The unity spoken of here is a picture of the genuine oneness in the New Testament. This oneness is the processed and consummated Triune God mingled with the believers in Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v17_21>John 17:21</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v17_23>23</a>). Since the Body of Christ is such a mingling (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_4>Eph. 4:4</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v4_6>6</a>), the Body itself is the oneness. According to the picture in this psalm, the genuine oneness is constituted of the spreading ointment and the descending dew for the gradual building up of the Body of Christ in the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity."
BD[">10\x8c"]="The Lord sends out a word against Jacob, / And it descends upon Israel."

BD[">-8\x98"]="<b>holy</b><br> &emsp; Righteousness is the base for holiness, and on this base holiness is exhibited. Hence, holiness is higher than righteousness. With His righteousness as the base, God shows Himself as the holy God. In righteousness He exhibits His holiness.<br> &emsp; God could expect only righteousness from the nations because they are not the sons of God. It is with His sons that God expects to see holiness (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_4>Eph. 1:4</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_5>5</a>). God&rsquo;s chastening and disciplining is to uplift us from righteousness to holiness (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_5>Heb. 12:5</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v12_11>11</a>). In His salvation He first justifies us to make us righteous in Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v3_24>Rom. 3:24</a>), and then He sanctifies us to make us holy (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_19>Rom. 6:19</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v6_22>22</a>). To be righteous is to match God&rsquo;s way of doing things outwardly, but to be holy is to match God&rsquo;s nature inwardly."

BD[":>)\x98"]="<b>forsaken</b><br> &emsp; The question at the beginning of this psalm was spoken by David in his suffering, but it became a prophecy concerning Christ in His suffering of His redeeming death. While Christ was on the earth, God the Father was with Him all the time (<a href=Joh.htm#v8_29>John 8:29</a>), but at a certain point in His crucifixion, God left Him (<a href=Mat.htm#v27_45>Matt. 27:45</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v27_46>46</a>). God&rsquo;s leaving Him was economical, not essential. God could never leave Christ essentially, but economically God forsook Him for a time. Nevertheless, Christ died as the Son of God, a God-man; hence, in His death there is a divine and eternal element (<a href=Act.htm#v20_28>Acts 20:28</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_7>1&nbsp;John 1:7</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v9_12>Heb. 9:12</a>).
