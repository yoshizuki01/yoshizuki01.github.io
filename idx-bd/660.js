It was in his uplifted humanity with its human virtues that Christ with His divine attributes was expressed during his voyage. He magnified Christ continually in his adverse situation (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_20>Phil. 1:20</a>)."

The apostasy of Jeroboam can be considered a type of the apostasy in today&rsquo;s Christendom, with its divisive worship centers, its clergy-laity system, its self-ordained religious &ldquo;feasts,&rdquo; and its idolatry.

In the first Epistle the decline crept in subtly through different teachings (<a href=1Ti.htm#v1_3>1:3</a>), and in the second it had developed openly and was worsening through heresies (<a href=2Ti.htm#v2_16>2&nbsp;Tim. 2:16</a>-<a href=2Ti.htm#v2_18>18</a>).

The first Epistle emphasizes that God desires all His saved ones to have the full knowledge of the truth and that the church is the pillar and base of the truth (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>3:15</a>).
