His garments signify His perfect behavior in His humanity&mdash;His perfection in His human virtues. To touch His garments was actually to touch Him in His humanity, in which God was embodied (<a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>). By such a touch His divine power was transfused, through the perfection of His humanity, into the one who had touched Him, and it became her healing. The God who dwells in unapproachable light became touchable in the Slave-Savior through His humanity for her salvation and enjoyment. This was the service of the Slave-Savior, as the Slave of God, to the sick sinner."

This too is proof that the disciples, before they received the Spirit of power economically on the day of Pentecost, had received the Spirit of life essentially on the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection."
BD["Q2.\x97"]="<b>son</b><br> &emsp; The Lord sent the disciples to preach the gospel by going to every city and place and visiting people in their homes. This may serve to confirm our preaching of the gospel today by knocking on doors and visiting people from door to door. The Lord sent the disciples as lambs entering into the midst of wolves (<a href=Luk.htm#v10_3>v. 3</a>). However, among the wolves there were sons of peace, that is, sheep that the Lord was concerned about (<a href=Mat.htm#v9_36>Matt. 9:36</a>) and the harvest that He desired to reap (<a href=Luk.htm#v10_2>v. 2</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v9_37>Matt. 9:37</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v9_38>38</a>). Because these sheep and the harvest, both of which belonged to the Lord, were scattered and mixed with the wolves, it was necessary for the Lord&rsquo;s disciples to go into the midst of the wolves to seek them out house by house and to reap them. It is the same today. Preaching the gospel by going out to every place to visit people in their homes is ordained by God. It is absolutely different from today&rsquo;s religious way of holding large gatherings to carry out gospel campaigns."

The last three cases, in chs. <a href=Joh.htm#v8>8</a>&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v11>11</a>, form a group of signs signifying that, on the negative side, the Lord is life to us to deliver us from the three main negative things: sin, blindness, and death.<br> &emsp; The case in this chapter reveals all the matters related to the problem of sin: (1) the source of sin&mdash;the devil; (2) the three main items of sin&mdash;adultery and fornication, murder, and lies (vv. <a href=Joh.htm#v8_3>3</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v8_41>41</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v8_44>44</a>); (3) the bondage, or slavery, of sin; (4) the issue, or result, of sin&mdash;death; (5) the One who is without sin&mdash;the Lord; (6) the One who is qualified to condemn sin&mdash;the Lord; (7) the One who is qualified to forgive sin&mdash;the Lord; (8) the One who is able to set people free from sin&mdash;the Lord. The Lord is the ever-existing God, the great I Am, who became the Son of Man and was lifted up on the cross to bear our sins; hence, He is qualified to forgive our sins. Furthermore, the Lord, being the eternal God, can come into us to be life and light to deliver us from the bondage and darkness of sin.<br> &emsp; The case in this chapter shows also that the religion (represented by the temple&mdash;vv. <a href=Joh.htm#v8_2>2</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v8_20>20</a>) of law (vv. <a href=Joh.htm#v8_5>5</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v8_17>17</a>) cannot set people free from sin and death; but the Lord Jesus, the I Am, who became the Son of Man and was lifted up on the cross for the serpent-poisoned people, can do what religion and law cannot do. This chapter shows us that Christ, the great I Am, not only is versus sin and death but also is versus religion and law."
