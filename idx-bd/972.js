In this, the last, condition three things are stressed (<a href=1Ki.htm#v8_48>v. 48</a>): the Holy Land, typifying Christ as the portion allotted by God to the believers (see <a href=DeuN.htm#n8_7x1>note 7<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Deu.htm#v8>Deut. 8</a>); the holy city, signifying the kingdom of God in Christ (<a href=Psa.htm#v48_1>Psa. 48:1</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v48_2>2</a>); and the holy temple, signifying God&rsquo;s house, the church, on the earth (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_21>Eph. 2:21</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>). These are the three crucial things regarding God&rsquo;s economy. During the Babylonian captivity Daniel prayed toward the Holy Land, the holy city, and the holy temple three times a day by opening his window toward Jerusalem (<a href=Dan.htm#v6_10>Dan. 6:10</a>). This indicates that God will listen to our prayer when our prayer to God is toward Christ, the kingdom of God, and the house of God as the goal in God&rsquo;s eternal economy. This means that no matter for whom we are praying, our prayers should be aimed at the interests of God, i.e., at Christ and the church as God&rsquo;s interests on earth, for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s economy."
