BD["P)7\x97"]="<b>kingdom</b><br> &emsp; The kingdom of God is the ruling, the reigning, of God with all its blessing and enjoyment. It is the goal of the gospel of God and of Jesus Christ (see notes <a href=MrkN.htm#n4_3x2>3<sup>2</sup></a> and <a href=MrkN.htm#n4_26x3>26<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Mrk.htm#v4>ch. 4</a>). To enter into this kingdom, people need to repent of their sins and believe in the gospel that their sins may be forgiven and that they may be regenerated by God to have the divine life, which matches the divine nature of this kingdom (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_3>John 3:3</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v3_5>5</a>). All the believers in Christ can share the kingdom in the church age for their enjoyment of God in His righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit (<a href=Rom.htm#v14_17>Rom. 14:17</a>). This kingdom will become the kingdom of Christ and of God for the overcoming believers to inherit and enjoy in the coming kingdom age (<a href=1Co.htm#v6_9>1&nbsp;Cor. 6:9</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v6_10>10</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v5_21>Gal. 5:21</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v5_5>Eph. 5:5</a>) that they may reign with Christ a thousand years (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>Rev. 20:4</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>). Then, as the eternal kingdom it will be an eternal blessing of God&rsquo;s eternal life for all God&rsquo;s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_1>Rev. 21:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_4>4</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>22:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>5</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_14>14</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_17>17</a>). It was such a kingdom of God that had drawn near and into which the gospel of the Slave-Savior would bring His believers. For this kingdom the Slave-Savior told people to repent and believe in the gospel. See notes <a href=JohN.htm#n3_3x3>3<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Joh.htm#v3>John 3</a>, <a href=HebN.htm#n12_28x1>28<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v12>Heb. 12</a>, and <a href=MatN.htm#n5_3x4>3<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v5>Matt. 5</a>."

BD["O,7\x97"]="<b>Galilee</b><br> &emsp; Galilee was a place with a mixed population of Jews and Gentiles. Hence, it was called &ldquo;Galilee of the Gentiles&rdquo; and was despised by the orthodox Jews (<a href=Joh.htm#v7_41>John 7:41</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v7_52>52</a>). The newly appointed King began His kingly ministry for the kingdom of the heavens in such a despised place, far from the capital of the country, dignified Jerusalem, with its sacred temple, the center of the orthodox religion. This implied that the ministry of the newly anointed King was for a heavenly kingdom that was different from the earthly kingdom of David (the Messianic kingdom)."

This is strong evidence that the Slave-Savior has authority to forgive sins on earth."
