BD["O/?\x97"]="<b>knew</b><br> &emsp; Knew here means approved. The same word in <a href=Rom.htm#v7_15>Rom. 7:15</a> is translated acknowledge. The Lord never approved those who, in His name, prophesied, cast out demons, and did many works of power (<a href=Mat.htm#v7_22>v. 22</a>), but did those things not according to the will of the heavenly Father (<a href=Mat.htm#v7_21>v. 21</a>). The Lord did not deny that they did those things, but He considered those things lawlessness because they were not done according to the will of the heavenly Father; they were not done in line with the divine will. Thus, those who do such things, even in the Lord&rsquo;s name, will not enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but will depart from the Lord, that is, be excluded from the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age."
BD["Q0*\x97"]="<b>women</b><br> &emsp; The twelve called ones were following the Savior (<a href=Luk.htm#v8_1>v. 1</a>), and the healed women were ministering to the Savior and His followers out of their own possessions (<a href=Luk.htm#v8_3>v. 3</a>). A beautiful picture!"
BD["R+0\x97"]="<b>wind</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word for wind is the same as that for spirit. Whether it is rendered wind or spirit depends on the context. This verse refers to something that blows, the sound of which can be heard, indicating that the word should be rendered wind. A regenerated person is like the wind, which can be recognized but which is beyond understanding; even so, it is a fact, a reality."
BD["R*3\x97"]="<b>beginning</b><br> &emsp; The first mentioning of any matter in the Scriptures sets forth the principle of that matter. Therefore, this first sign sets forth the principle of all the following signs, that is, to change death into life.<br> &emsp; In the Scriptures, figuratively, the tree of life is the source of life and the tree of knowledge is the source of death, as revealed in <a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>Gen. 2:9</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v2_17>17</a>. The meaning of all the cases recorded in this Gospel corresponds with the principle that the tree of life results in life and the tree of knowledge results in death."
BD["O-E\x97"]="<b>pluck</b><br> &emsp; The emphasis of the new law of the kingdom in this verse and in <a href=Mat.htm#v5_30>v. 30</a> indicates the seriousness of sin in relation to the kingdom of the heavens and the need to put away the motive of sin at any cost. The actions described in these verses were not meant to be carried out literally; they can be carried out only spiritually, as revealed in <a href=Rom.htm#v8_13>Rom. 8:13</a> and <a href=Col.htm#v3_5>Col. 3:5</a>."

BD["O40\x97"]="<b>Lord</b><br> &emsp; Here the Lord indicated the third turn, a right-asserting turn from the Sabbath to the Lord of the Sabbath. As the Lord of the Sabbath, He had the right to change the regulations concerning the Sabbath. Thus, the Lord gave the condemning Pharisees a threefold verdict. He was the real David, the greater temple, and the Lord of the Sabbath. Therefore, He could do whatever He liked on the Sabbath, and whatever He did was justified by Himself. He was above all rituals and regulations. Since He was there, no attention should have been paid to any ritual or regulation."

BD["O33\x97"]="<b>least</b><br> &emsp; Lit., less. All the prophets prior to John prophesied only that Christ was coming, but John testified that Christ had come. The prophets were looking forward to Christ, but John saw Christ. Hence, John was greater than all the prophets. Although John saw the incarnated Christ and introduced Him to people, he did not have the resurrected Christ indwelling him. The kingdom people do. John could say only, &ldquo;Here is Christ,&rdquo; but the kingdom people can say, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>Phil. 1:21</a>). Hence, the least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he. Whether a person is greater or lesser depends on his relationship to Christ. Christ is the deciding factor. The closer one is to Christ, the greater one is."
BD["S**\x97"]="<b>wind</b><br> &emsp; In the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection the Spirit of resurrection life is likened to breath, breathed into the disciples (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_22>John 20:22</a>) for their spiritual being and living essentially. In the Lord&rsquo;s ascension the Spirit of ascension power, poured upon the disciples, is symbolized here by the wind and is for the disciples&rsquo; ministry and move economically. The essential Spirit of resurrection life is for the believers to live Christ; the economical Spirit of ascension power is for them to carry out His commission."

The kingly Savior is not only the Bridegroom to the kingdom people for their enjoyment but also their new garment for them to be equipped outwardly that they may be qualified to attend the wedding. Furthermore, He is their new life to stir them up inwardly to enjoy Him as their Bridegroom. He, as the heavenly King, is the Bridegroom for the kingdom people&rsquo;s enjoyment, and His heavenly kingdom is His wedding feast (<a href=Mat.htm#v22_2>22:2</a>), at which they will enjoy Him. To enjoy Him as the Bridegroom in the kingdom feast, they need Him as their new garment outwardly and their new wine inwardly."
