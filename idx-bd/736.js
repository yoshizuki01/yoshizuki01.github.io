BD["W+.\x97"]="<b>Abraham</b><br> &emsp; In drifting back to the law, the bewitched Galatians clung to Moses, through whom the law was given; but Paul referred them to Abraham, who was the father of faith. Faith was of God&rsquo;s original economy; the law was added later because of the transgressions (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_19>v. 19</a>). After Christ fulfilled the law through His death, God wanted His people to return to His original economy. With Abraham it was not a matter of keeping the law but of believing God. It should be so with all the New Testament believers."
BD["W*1\x97"]="<b>James</b><br> &emsp; When the apostles were listed, Peter was usually mentioned first (<a href=Mat.htm#v10_2>Matt. 10:2</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v3_16>Mark 3:16</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v6_14>Luke 6:14</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v1_13>Acts 1:13</a>). Here, however, James was mentioned first. This indicates that at that time Peter was not the foremost leading one in the church; rather, it was James, the brother of the Lord (<a href=Gal.htm#v1_19>1:19</a>). This is confirmed by <a href=Act.htm#v15_13>Acts 15:13</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v15_21>21</a>, where James, not Peter, was the authority who gave the final, decisive word in the conference held in Jerusalem. It must have been because of Peter&rsquo;s weakness in not holding the truth of the gospel, as illustrated by Paul in vv. <a href=Gal.htm#v2_11>11</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v2_14>14</a>, that James came to the forefront to take the lead among the apostles. Hence, both in <a href=Gal.htm#v2_12>v. 12</a> and in <a href=Act.htm#v21_18>Acts 21:18</a> James was considered the representative of the church in Jerusalem and of the apostles. This is strong proof that Peter was not always the foremost leader in the church. Furthermore, this implies that leadership in the church is not organizational and perpetual; rather, it is spiritual and fluctuates according to the spiritual condition of the leading ones. This strongly rebuts Catholicism in its assertion that Peter was the only successor of Christ in the administration of the church."
