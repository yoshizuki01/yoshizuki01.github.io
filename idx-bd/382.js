BD["N+)\x97"]="<b>My</b><br> &emsp; Heb. malachi. First, this prophecy concerning the coming of Jehovah&rsquo;s messenger was fulfilled in the coming of the prophet Malachi, a type of Christ as the coming One. Second, this prophecy was fulfilled in the first coming of Christ with John the Baptist as His forerunner (<a href=Isa.htm#v40_3>Isa. 40:3</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v40_5>5</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v11_7>Matt. 11:7</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v11_13>13</a>). In His first coming Christ came as a Messenger and even as the message sent by God. As the Messenger of God, Christ not only brings a word or a message from God to God&rsquo;s people; He Himself is the living message. This is proven by the four Gospels, which are a complete and perfect record of Christ as the living message sent by God to His chosen people (see <a href=HebN.htm#n1_2x2>note 2<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v1>Heb. 1</a>). As God&rsquo;s Messenger Christ came to adjust, refine, and purify the priests. In the Gospels the Lord Jesus frequently rebuked the priests. Third, this prophecy will be fulfilled in the second coming of Christ with Elijah as His forerunner (<a href=Mal.htm#v4_5>4:5</a> and <a href=MalN.htm#n4_5x1>note</a>)."
BD["AR)\x97"]="<b>chamber</b><br> &emsp; The holy chambers, located on both the north side and the south side, are buildings that connect the inner court with the outer court. The chambers on the pavement in the outer court are for the people to eat the offerings (<a href=Ezk.htm#v40_17>40:17</a> and <a href=EzkN.htm#n40_17x1>note</a>), whereas the holy chambers are for the priests to eat the offerings and also to place and store the offerings and to lay their priestly garments (vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v42_13>13</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v42_14>14</a>). Whereas the offerings signify Christ as our enjoyment, the priestly garments signify Christ as our expression (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n28_2x1>notes</a> on <a href=Exo.htm#v28_2>Exo. 28:2</a>).<br> &emsp; In the holy chambers we reach the highest peak of spiritual experience. To live in the holy chambers is to live in Christ, to eat the offerings in the holy chambers is to eat Christ, and to wear the holy garments is to wear Christ for His expression."
BD["M.)\x97"]="<b>four</b><br> &emsp; The four chariots signify the four winds (vv. <a href=Zec.htm#v6_4>4</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v6_8>8</a>) from the four corners of the earth (<a href=Rev.htm#v7_1>Rev. 7:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v7_3>3</a>) for God&rsquo;s judging of sins upon the earth. These four winds are used by God to carry out His administration in the entire universe. In particular, they are used by God to carry out His judgment, not mainly on individual persons but on nations, governments, and kingdoms. God&rsquo;s sovereign &ldquo;blowing of the wind&rdquo; brings in the different craftsmen to judge the nations that damage and destroy Israel (<a href=Zec.htm#v1_20>1:20</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v1_21>21</a>). See <a href=ZecN.htm#n1_18x1>note 18<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Zec.htm#v1>ch. 1</a>."
BD["M-,\x97"]="<b>it</b><br> &emsp; Referring to God&rsquo;s judgment. The description in this verse indicates that the exercise of God&rsquo;s judgment of sins will be most serious and also very thorough."
BD["AP/\x97"]="<b>guardroom</b><br> &emsp; Or, little chamber. So also throughout this chapter. The six guardrooms are divided into two groups of three (<a href=Ezk.htm#v40_10>v. 10</a>), signifying that the guardrooms are a person, Christ Himself, who as the Triune God (three) became a man (six) and was &ldquo;split&rdquo; on the cross. Each of the six guardrooms is six cubits square and is thus the same in size as a cross section of the wall (see <a href=EzkN.htm#n40_5x1>note 5<sup>1</sup></a>). This indicates that the Lord Jesus in His person and work is the guard of God&rsquo;s glory and holiness. By passing through Christ as the gate, we are qualified to enter into God&rsquo;s building, which is full of God&rsquo;s glory and holiness."
BD["A.))o9"]="<b>3.</b>&nbsp; The judgment on the land of Israel"
BD["M,/\x97"]="<b>bring</b><br> &emsp; To bring forth the topstone is to complete the building. The shouts of &ldquo;Grace, grace to it!&rdquo; indicate that the topstone itself is grace. The topstone typifies Christ, who is the grace from God to us to be the covering of God&rsquo;s building (see <a href=1CoN.htm#n15_10x1>note 10<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=1Co.htm#v15>1&nbsp;Cor. 15</a>). Christ is the foundation stone to uphold God&rsquo;s building (<a href=Isa.htm#v28_16>Isa. 28:16</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v3_11>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:11</a>), the cornerstone to join together the Gentile and Jewish members of His Body (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_20>Eph. 2:20</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_6>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:6</a>), and the topstone to consummate God&rsquo;s building."

BD["9*3)o7"]="<b>A.</b>&nbsp; The coming and consoling of Job's three friends"
BD["?X)\x97"]="<b>Moab</b><br> &emsp; Moab, the first forefather of the Moabites, was born of Lot through his committing incest with his daughters (<a href=Gen.htm#v19_30>Gen. 19:30</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v19_38>38</a>). Moab as a nation typifies the world of fleshly lust that corrupts and frustrates God&rsquo;s chosen people, through the greedy religionists, from following and walking with God in His holy way (<a href=Num.htm#v25_1>Num. 25:1</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v25_5>5</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_15>2&nbsp;Pet. 2:15</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v2_14>Rev. 2:14</a>). It was Moab who hired Balaam, the Gentile prophet, to stumble the children of Israel (<a href=Num.htm#v22_1>Num. 22:1</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v22_21>21</a>; <a href=Deu.htm#v23_4>Deut. 23:4</a>).<br> &emsp; The Moabites were not allowed to enter into the assembly of Jehovah even to the tenth generation (<a href=Deu.htm#v23_3>Deut. 23:3</a>). However, Ruth, a Moabitess, became the mother of one of the prominent forefathers of Christ (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_5>Matt. 1:5b</a>) because of her allegiance to Israel in the interest of God (<a href=Rut.htm#v1_14>Ruth 1:14</a>-<a href=Rut.htm#v1_18>18</a>). This indicates that although the Moabites were condemned, at a certain time God had compassion on them."
BD["M+2\x97"]="<b>vine</b><br> &emsp; After our sin has been taken away (<a href=Zec.htm#v3_9>v. 9</a>) and our situation with God has been appeased, there is peace between us and God, and we can come together to enjoy Christ as the vine (<a href=Joh.htm#v15_1>John 15:1</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v15_5>5</a>), the tree of life (see <a href=GenN.htm#n2_9x2>note 9<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v2>Gen. 2</a> and notes <a href=RevN.htm#n22_2x1>2<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n22_2x2>2<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v22>Rev. 22</a>), and as the fig tree, full of the fruit of life (<a href=Jdg.htm#v9_10>Judg. 9:10</a>-<a href=Jdg.htm#v9_11>11</a>). Christ came to accomplish redemption, bearing the Spirit and being cut by God on the cross (see notes <a href=ZecN.htm#n3_9x2>9<sup>2</sup></a> and <a href=ZecN.htm#n3_9x3>9<sup>3</sup></a>). This issued in our enjoyment of Him as the vine and as the fig tree. The measuring carried out by Christ as the Angel of Jehovah results in such a wonderful situation."
BD["M+1\x9a"]="<b>remove</b><br> &emsp; This indicates that the Christ on whom God has worked will remove the sin of the land of Israel in one day, the day of His crucifixion (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_24>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:24</a>). Through His death on the cross, Christ, the Lamb of God, took away the sin of the world (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>John 1:29</a>)."
BD[">[)\x97"]="<b>rock</b><br> &emsp; Referring not to God but to Abraham, who was the source of Israel. Jehovah&rsquo;s calling of Israel is based on His calling of their father Abraham; hence, it is firm."
BD["AM8\x97"]="<b>wood</b><br> &emsp; The two lifeless pieces of wood symbolize the two parts of the divided nation of Israel, the southern kingdom of Judah and the northern kingdom of Israel. These two kingdoms could not be one, and in the eyes of the Lord they were thoroughly dead and dried up. After being enlivened, they are able to be joined together and become one (<a href=Ezk.htm#v37_17>v. 17</a>). See <a href=EzkN.htm#n37_10x1>note 10<sup>1</sup></a>. Whereas the dry bones in vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v37_1>1</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v37_14>14</a> are for forming an army to fight the battle for God, the pieces of wood in vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v37_16>16</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v37_22>22</a> are for the building of the house of God as His dwelling place."
BD["M*5\x97"]="<b>Hush</b><br> &emsp; Before the glory returned to Jerusalem, Jehovah was silent, but after the glory He was roused up from His holy habitation. All flesh&mdash;including the flesh of the Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans&mdash;must be silent. Only Jehovah has the right to speak, and only He is the deciding factor."
BD[">Z,\x97"]="<b>me</b><br> &emsp; Referring to Isaiah, who typifies Christ as the Servant of Jehovah (see <a href=Isa.htm#v49_1>49:1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v49_5>5</a>). Verses <a href=Isa.htm#v50_4>4</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v50_5>5</a> speak of the instruction received by Christ as Jehovah&rsquo;s Servant."
BD["M)8\x97"]="<b>measuring</b><br> &emsp; Measuring for the purpose of possessing. For seventy years Jerusalem was given up by God (<a href=Zec.htm#v1_12>v. 12</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v25_11>Jer. 25:11</a>). Now He was coming back to repossess the city; thus, He caused a measuring line to be stretched over it (<a href=Zec.htm#v2_1>2:1</a>)."

From His resurrection until today He has been not only glorified, honored, by God (<a href=Isa.htm#v49_5>v. 5c</a>) but also respected by human kings and worshipped by human princes."
