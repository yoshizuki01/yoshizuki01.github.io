In typology salt signifies the killing power and the preserving power of Christ&rsquo;s death. The seasoning of the four ingredients of the incense with salt signifies that our prayer needs to be &ldquo;salted&rdquo; by the cross so that all the impure motives in our heart and the bias in our spirit may be killed. For God&rsquo;s coming to us in the compound ointment, the Spirit, the oil, is needed (<a href=Exo.htm#v30_24>v. 24</a>); for our going to God in prayer, the cross, the salt, is needed."

Satan could instigate the Jewish religionists and utilize the Gentile politicians to bind the apostles and their evangelistic ministry, but he could not bind Christ&rsquo;s living witnesses and their living testimonies. The more they bound the apostles and their evangelistic ministry, the stronger and brighter these martyrs of Christ and their living testimonies became. In His appearing to the apostle, the Lord indicated that He would not rescue him immediately from his bonds but would leave him in bonds and bring him to Rome that he might testify concerning Him, as he had done in Jerusalem. The Lord encouraged Paul to do this."

The former was of Jewish origin; the latter, of a heathen source.<br> &emsp; Basically, the exhortation in this chapter was prompted by these two groups of people. In speaking of the Judaizers, it edified the Philippians concerning the matter of dealing with the soul (vv. <a href=Phi.htm#v3_1>1</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_16>16</a>), especially with the mind; and in alluding to the Epicureans, it instructed the believers concerning the matter of dealing with the body (vv. <a href=Phi.htm#v3_17>17</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_21>21</a>).
