In this first parable the Lord went out only to sow the seed for the kingdom. At that time the seed had not yet grown to be the crop for the formation of the kingdom.

In the case of David there was a turn from one age to another. In this case, a case concerning the priests, there was a turn from the temple to a person who is greater than the temple. Since the priests were guiltless in acting on the Sabbath in the temple, how could the Lord&rsquo;s disciples be guilty in acting on the Sabbath in Him who is greater than the temple? In the first case the king broke the Levitical regulation; in the second case the priests broke the sabbatical regulation. According to the Scriptures neither was guilty.

BD[":s.\x97"]="<b>south</b><br> &emsp; The fact that exaltation comes neither from the east nor from the west nor from the south indicates that it comes from the north, i.e., from God, who dwells in the north (cf. <a href=Isa.htm#v14_13>Isa. 14:13</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v14_14>14</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v1_4>Ezek. 1:4</a>; <a href=Psa.htm#v48_2>Psa. 48:2</a>). Furthermore, this indicates that Christ as the Judge (see <a href=PsaN.htm#n75_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a>) is unique. Exaltation should not come from any direction other than where He dwells. Therefore, preeminence should be given to Him (<a href=Col.htm#v1_18>Col. 1:18</a>)."

BD["O/=\x97"]="<b>enter</b><br> &emsp; To enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we need to do two things: call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father. To call on the Lord suffices for us to be saved (<a href=Rom.htm#v10_13>Rom. 10:13</a>), but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we also need to do the will of the heavenly Father. Hence, not everyone who says, &ldquo;Lord, Lord,&rdquo; will enter into the kingdom of the heavens; but those who call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father will enter in.<br> &emsp; Since entering into the kingdom of the heavens requires doing the will of the heavenly Father, it is clearly different from entering into the kingdom of God through regeneration (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_3>John 3:3</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v3_5>5</a>).

Benjamin, mentioned here, had two names, the first of which was Ben-oni. This name, given to him by his mother Rachel as she was dying in childbirth, means son of my affliction (<a href=Gen.htm#v35_18>Gen. 35:18a</a>). As the son of affliction, Benjamin typifies Christ, who, as the man of sorrows (<a href=Isa.htm#v53_3>Isa. 53:3</a>) in His incarnation and human life on earth, accomplished God&rsquo;s eternal redemption for His full salvation (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_12>Heb. 9:12</a>). Whereas Rachel named her son Ben-oni, Jacob immediately changed the child&rsquo;s name to Benjamin, which means son of the right hand (<a href=Gen.htm#v35_18>Gen. 35:18b</a>). To be at the right hand is to be in a position of glory and honor. As the son of the right hand, Benjamin typifies Christ, who, as the Son of the right hand in His resurrection, victory, and ascension, ministers in the heavens to carry out the application of God&rsquo;s redemption for His salvation (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_1>Heb. 8:1</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v8_2>2</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v7_25>7:25</a>). Christ was incarnated to be Ben-oni, the man of sorrows, but in resurrection He became Benjamin, the Son of the right hand in glory and honor (<a href=Psa.htm#v80_17>80:17</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v16_19>Mark 16:19</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v2_33>Acts 2:33</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v5_31>5:31</a>)."
