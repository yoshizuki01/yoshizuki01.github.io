The two witnesses here are Moses and Elijah.

Moses and Elijah appeared before the Lord on the mount of transfiguration (<a href=Mat.htm#v17_1>Matt. 17:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v17_3>3</a>). Moses, representing the law, and Elijah, representing the prophets (<a href=Luk.htm#v16_16>Luke 16:16</a>), both testified for God. Elijah&rsquo;s mission was predicted (<a href=Mal.htm#v4_5>Mal. 4:5</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v17_11>Matt. 17:11</a>). They are the two olive trees, the two sons of oil, in <a href=Zec.htm#v4_3>Zech. 4:3</a>, <a href=Zec.htm#v4_11>11</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v4_14>14</a> (see <a href=MatN.htm#n25_9x2>note 9<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v25>Matt. 25</a>)."
BD[":P.\x97"]="<b>You</b><br> &emsp; The word in vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v40_6>6</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v40_8>8</a> is actually the word of Christ, as quoted by Paul in <a href=Heb.htm#v10_5>Heb. 10:5</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_7>7</a>. The prophecy in vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v40_6>6</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v40_8>8</a> is one of the greatest revelations concerning the all-inclusive Christ in the commission that God committed to Christ in His first coming through incarnation, which was to put away the animal sacrifices of the old covenant and to establish Himself, in His body, as the sacrifice of the new covenant (see notes <a href=HebN.htm#n10_7x2>7<sup>2</sup></a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n10_9x1>9<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v10>Heb. 10</a>). This is to terminate God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy and to initiate God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, in which Christ replaces all the offerings as well as all things, all matters, and all persons (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v17_4>Matt. 17:4</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v17_8>8</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v2_16>Col. 2:16</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v2_17>17</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v3_10>3:10</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v3_11>11</a>).<br> &emsp; The prophecy in vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v40_6>6</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v40_8>8</a> concerning Christ is the goal and destination of the revelation of Christ in <a href=Psa.htm#v2>Psa. 2</a>, <a href=Psa.htm#v8>8</a>, <a href=Psa.htm#v16>16</a>, and <a href=Psa.htm#v22>22</a>&mdash;<a href=Psa.htm#v24>24</a>. In this prophecy Christ comes through His incarnation to terminate God&rsquo;s old economy and initiate God&rsquo;s new economy, His New Testament economy, by replacing the animal sacrifices and establishing Himself as the unique sacrifice of the new covenant. As such a sacrifice, Christ is the factor that enacts God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (<a href=Mat.htm#v26_28>Matt. 26:28</a>) that He may be its centrality and universality for the producing and building up of the church as His organic Body, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Hence, Christ has changed the age for the consummating of God&rsquo;s new creation out of God&rsquo;s old creation (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:17</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v6_15>Gal. 6:15</a>). His changing of the age is greater than the creation of the universe mentioned in <a href=Gen.htm#v1>Gen. 1</a>."

It will take place before the fifth trumpet, the first of the three woes (<a href=Rev.htm#v8_13>Rev. 8:13</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n8_13x1>note</a>), which are the major structure of the great tribulation, in the great and terrible day of Jehovah (<a href=Joe.htm#v2_31>v. 31b</a>). See <a href=RevN.htm#n6_12x1>note 12<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v6>Rev. 6</a>.<br> &emsp; In spite of such an outpouring of the Spirit, many of the returned Jews will not believe but will continue to be stubborn. Eventually, during the tribulation, Jerusalem will be surrounded by the Gentile armies under Antichrist, whose intention will be to destroy Israel entirely (<a href=Zec.htm#v14_2>Zech. 14:2</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v16_13>Rev. 16:13</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v16_16>16</a>). At that juncture the Lord Jesus Christ will descend with His overcomers, His mighty ones (<a href=Joe.htm#v3_11>3:11</a>). Furthermore, according to <a href=Zec.htm#v12_10>Zech. 12:10</a>, at that time the consummated Spirit will again be poured out, and the remnant of the children of Israel will be saved. Thus, the three outpourings of the Holy Spirit&mdash;on the day of Pentecost, just before the great tribulation, and at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming&mdash;work together for the salvation of Israel."

This will be the beginning of the great tribulation (<a href=Mat.htm#v24_21>Matt. 24:21</a>), which will last for three and a half years (<a href=Dan.htm#v7_25>7:25</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v12_7>12:7</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v11_2>Rev. 11:2</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v11_3>3</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v12_6>12:6</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v12_14>14</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v13_5>13:5</a>).
