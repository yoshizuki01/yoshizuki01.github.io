Luke&rsquo;s narrative has a spiritual significance. The blind man&rsquo;s receiving of sight was followed in <a href=Luk.htm#v19_1>19:1</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v19_9>9</a> by the salvation of Zaccheus. This indicates that to receive salvation one must first have sight to see the Savior. These two cases, occurring at Jericho one after the other, should be considered, spiritually, as one complete case. A sinner in darkness needs to receive sight that he may realize that he needs salvation (<a href=Act.htm#v26_18>Acts 26:18</a>).<br> &emsp; What is covered in <a href=Luk.htm#v18_35>18:35</a>&mdash;<a href=Luk.htm#v19_10>19:10</a> shows how one can fulfill the conditions revealed in vv. <a href=Luk.htm#v18_9>9</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v18_30>30</a> for entering the kingdom of God&mdash;first, one must receive sight from the Savior (vv. <a href=Luk.htm#v18_35>35</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v18_43>43</a>), and then one must receive the Savior as the dynamic salvation (<a href=Luk.htm#v19_1>19:1</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v19_10>10</a>). In this way the blind man could be like the repenting tax collector and the unoccupied little child and receive the Savior, and Zaccheus could renounce all his riches and follow Him. The way to enter into all spiritual things is to receive sight from the Lord and to receive the Lord Himself."
