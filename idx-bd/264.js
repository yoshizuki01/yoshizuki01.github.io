Because of Satan&rsquo;s failure, these two positions have been given to the believers in Christ (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_9>9</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v1_6>Rev. 1:6</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v5_10>5:10</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v2_26>2:26</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v2_27>27</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v3_21>3:21</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v12_5>12:5</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>20:6</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_3>22:3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>5</a>)."
