BD["i>6\x9a"]="<b>right</b><br> &emsp; After being created, man was put before the tree of life (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_8>Gen. 2:8</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>9</a>), indicating that he was privileged to partake of it. But because of the fall of man, the way to the tree of life was closed to man by God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness (<a href=Gen.htm#v3_24>Gen. 3:24</a>). Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, which fulfilled all the requirements of God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness, the way to the tree of life was opened again to believers (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_19>Heb. 10:19</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_20>20</a>). Hence, those who wash their robes in the redeeming blood of Christ have the right to enjoy the tree of life as their eternal portion in the holy city, the Paradise of God, in eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_7>2:7</a>)."
