BD["*2)\x98"]="<b>strange</b><br> &emsp; The strange fire offered by Nadab and Abihu was common fire, not holy fire. It was not fire from the altar (<a href=Lev.htm#v16_12>16:12</a>), which came forth from God, from heaven (<a href=Lev.htm#v9_24>9:24</a>), but fire from man, from the earth, with no base of expiation. Strange fire signifies man&rsquo;s natural enthusiasm, natural affection, natural strength, and natural ability offered to God. Nadab and Abihu did something for God, but they did it in a natural way. Hence, God judged this offering by consuming the two priests (<a href=Lev.htm#v10_2>v. 2</a>). This is a strong warning showing us that in touching the divine things we need to apply the cross to our natural life. Otherwise, our careless touching of the holy things of God will bring in spiritual deadness, and may even result in physical death (<a href=Act.htm#v5_1>Acts 5:1</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v5_11>11</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v11_27>1&nbsp;Cor. 11:27</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v11_32>32</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_16>1&nbsp;John 5:16</a>), as a judgment from the holy God.
