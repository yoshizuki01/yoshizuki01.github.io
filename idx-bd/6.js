BD["M10\x97"]="<b>house</b><br> &emsp; This verse reveals that during the attack of Alexander the Great, the Lord protected Jerusalem with the temple, which was His house. Although Alexander, a mighty king, caused damage to many nations around Judah, he did not cause much damage to Judah and Jerusalem, and he did not damage the temple at all.
