BD["U)/\x97"]="<b>gift</b><br> &emsp; Gift here refers to the inward gifts issuing from grace, such as the free gift of eternal life (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_23>Rom. 6:23</a>) and the gift of the Holy Spirit (<a href=Act.htm#v2_38>Acts 2:38</a>) as the heavenly gift (<a href=Heb.htm#v6_4>Heb. 6:4</a>). It does not refer to the outward, miraculous gifts, such as healing, speaking in tongues, etc., mentioned in chs. <a href=1Co.htm#v12>12</a> and <a href=1Co.htm#v14>14</a>. All the inward gifts are constituents of grace. They are the initial things of the divine life that are received of grace. All these need to grow (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_6>3:6</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_7>7</a>) to their full development and maturity. The Corinthian believers were not lacking in the initial gifts in life, but they were desperately short of the growth in life. Hence, however much they had been initially enriched in grace, they were still infants in Christ, soulish, fleshly, and even fleshy (<a href=1Co.htm#v2_14>2:14</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>, <a href=1Co.htm#v3_3>3</a>)."

In the recovery and restoration (<a href=Psa.htm#v80>Psa. 80</a>) the loveliness and sweetness of God&rsquo;s house is intensified.<br> &emsp; The intrinsic content of <a href=Psa.htm#v84>Psa. 84</a> is the secret revelation concerning the enjoyment of Christ as the incarnated Triune God, the God-man. The center of this secret revelation is the house of God (vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v84_4>4</a>, <a href=Psa.htm#v84_10>10</a>), typified by the tabernacle (<a href=Exo.htm#v40_2>Exo. 40:2</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v40_8>8</a>) and the temple (<a href=1Ki.htm#v6_1>1&nbsp;Kings 6:1</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v6_3>3</a>; <a href=1Ki.htm#v8_3>8:3</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v8_11>11</a>). Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God (<a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>) is the fulfillment of the types of the tabernacle and the temple. This fulfillment commenced in His incarnation as the individual Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v2_21>2:21</a>) and will continue until it consummates in the New Jerusalem as the corporate Christ, the great God-man (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>Rev. 21:2</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_22>22</a>). The New Testament, from Matthew through Revelation, covers the entire span of the incarnation of the Triune God and is a record of the divine incarnation. The enjoyment of Christ as the incarnated Triune God in God&rsquo;s house is portrayed by the arrangement of the tabernacle and its furnishings (see <a href=PsaN.htm#n84_3x1>note 3<sup>1</sup></a> in this chapter and notes <a href=HebN.htm#n9_4x1>4<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n9_4x3>4<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v9>Heb. 9</a>)."

The place chosen by God for His habitation typifies the human spirit, where God&rsquo;s habitation is today (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>Eph. 2:22</a>). The offerings typify Christ; Christ is the fulfillment and reality of all the offerings with which the people worshipped God. Hence, when the Lord instructed the woman to worship God the Spirit in spirit and truthfulness, He meant that she should contact God the Spirit in her spirit instead of in a specific location, and through Christ instead of with the offerings. Since Christ, as the reality that issues in the human virtue of truthfulness, has come (vv. <a href=Joh.htm#v4_25>25</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v4_26>26</a>), all the shadows and types are over."
