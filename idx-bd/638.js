BD["A)D\x97"]="<b>rainbow</b><br> &emsp; A rainbow as the brightness around the man who is sitting on the throne signifies the splendor and glory around the Lord on the throne. At Noah&rsquo;s time the rainbow in the cloud was a sign of God&rsquo;s faithfulness in keeping His covenant with man and every living creature that He would never again destroy mankind with a flood (see <a href=GenN.htm#n9_13x1>note 13<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v9>Gen. 9</a>).<br> &emsp; A rainbow can be considered as being produced from the combining of three basic colors&mdash;red, yellow, and blue. Red, the color of fire, refers to God&rsquo;s holiness; yellow, the color of electrum, signifies God&rsquo;s glory; and blue, the color of the sapphire throne, signifies God&rsquo;s righteousness. God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory are three divine attributes that keep sinners away from God (see <a href=GenN.htm#n3_24x1>note 24<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v3>Gen. 3</a>). However, Christ came, died on the cross to satisfy the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory, and was resurrected, and He is now our righteousness, holiness, and glory (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>). Because we, the believers, are now in Christ, in the sight of God we bear the appearance of Christ as righteousness, holiness, and glory. This is the appearance of a rainbow as a testimony of God&rsquo;s faithfulness in sparing us and saving us, the fallen ones, from His judgment on sinners. In the New Jerusalem, a city whose foundations have the appearance of a rainbow (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_19>Rev. 21:19</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_20>20</a>), we, the aggregate of the saved ones, will be a rainbow reflecting the brightness of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory and testifying forever that our God is righteous and faithful (see <a href=RevN.htm#n21_19x1P2>note 19<sup>1</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=Rev.htm#v21>Rev. 21</a>). As portrayed in this chapter, the Christian life and the church life will consummate in such a rainbow. At that point God&rsquo;s eternal plan will have been accomplished."
