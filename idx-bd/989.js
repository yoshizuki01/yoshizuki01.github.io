BD["C/)\x97"]="<b>iniquity</b><br> &emsp; The sins of Israel were in two categories: sins in their social life among the people and the rulers (vv. <a href=Hos.htm#v7_1>1</a>-<a href=Hos.htm#v7_7>7</a>) and evils in their relationship with Jehovah (vv. <a href=Hos.htm#v7_8>8</a>-<a href=Hos.htm#v7_16>16</a>). Israel was wrong with man and also with God."
BD["?75\x97"]="<b>Your</b><br> &emsp; The pronouns your and you in vv. <a href=Jer.htm#v15_13>13</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v15_14>14</a>, referring to both Israel and Jeremiah, indicate that God regarded Jeremiah the prophet as being one with Israel and that God considered the entire nation of Israel as one entity. Because Jeremiah was a part of this entity, when the wealth and treasures of Israel were given to their enemies, Jeremiah also became poor."
BD["C.,\x97"]="<b>Ephraim</b><br> &emsp; Another term for the northern kingdom of Israel. So also throughout the book."
BD[":\x9f{\x8c"]="For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke; / But I do not forget Your statutes."

See <a href=DanN.htm#n1_21x1>note 21<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Dan.htm#v1>ch. 1</a>."
BD["h);\x98"]="<b>spirit</b><br> &emsp; The human spirit, not the Spirit of God. The apostates are devoid of spirit. They &ldquo;have not indeed ceased to have a spirit, as a part of their own tripartite nature [<a href=1Th.htm#v5_23>1&nbsp;Thes. 5:23</a>]: but they have ceased to possess it in any worthy sense: it is degraded beneath and under the power of the psyche [soul], the personal life, so as to have no real vitality of its own&rdquo; (Alford). They do not care for their spirit or use it. They do not contact God by their spirit in communion with the Spirit of God; neither do they live and walk in their spirit. They have been drawn downward by their flesh and have become fleshy, so that they have lost the consciousness of their conscience (see <a href=2PeN.htm#n2_12x2>note 12<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=2Pe.htm#v2>2&nbsp;Pet. 2</a>) and have become like animals without reason (<a href=Jud.htm#v10>v. 10</a>)."
BD["i-*\x8c"]="And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?"
BD["B0/\x97"]="<b>broke</b><br> &emsp; This indicates that Alexander the Great conquered Medo-Persia and destroyed it."
BD["i,-\x8c"]="And out of the throne come forth lightnings and voices and thunders. And <I>there</I> <I>were</I> seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;"

BD["i+,\x98"]="<b>white</b><br> &emsp; White signifies not only purity but also approvedness. White garments here signify the walk and living that are unspotted by death and that will be approved by the Lord. This is a qualification for walking with the Lord, especially in the coming kingdom."
BD["E))\x97"]="<b>Amos</b><br> &emsp; Meaning burden bearer. The central thought of Amos&rsquo;s prophecy, which is nearly the same as that of Hosea and Joel, is that Jehovah punishes the nations and chastises Israel that the age of restoration (<a href=Mat.htm#v19_28>Matt. 19:28</a>) may be brought in for the kingdom of David (<a href=Amo.htm#v9_11>9:11</a>-<a href=Amo.htm#v9_12>12</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v15_15>Acts 15:15</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v15_16>16</a>)&mdash;the kingdom of Christ (<a href=Rev.htm#v11_15>Rev. 11:15</a>)."

BD["i*/\x98"]="<b>Spirit</b><br> &emsp; At the beginning of each of the seven epistles recorded in chs. <a href=Rev.htm#v2>2</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v3>3</a>, it is the Lord who speaks (vv. <a href=Rev.htm#v2_1>1</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v2_8>8</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v2_12>12</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v2_18>18</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v3_7>7</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v3_14>14</a>). But at the end of each epistle, it is the Spirit who speaks to the churches (vv. <a href=Rev.htm#v2_7>7</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v2_11>11</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v2_17>17</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v2_29>29</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v3_6>3:6</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v3_13>13</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v3_22>22</a>). This not only indicates that the Spirit is the Lord and the Lord is the Spirit, but it also emphasizes that in the darkness of the church&rsquo;s degradation the Spirit is vitally important, as indicated by the sevenfold intensified Spirit in <a href=Rev.htm#v1_4>1:4</a>. The same emphasis is seen also in <a href=Rev.htm#v14_13>14:13</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v22_17>22:17</a>."
BD[":\xb73\x8c"]="For Your name&rsquo;s sake, O Jehovah, preserve me alive; / In Your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble."
BD[">>)\x97"]="<b>valley</b><br> &emsp; Even Jerusalem was included in Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment upon the nations. In His judgment Jehovah would trample down the city of Jerusalem&mdash;the valley of vision (vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v22_5>5</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v22_7>7</a>)&mdash;because of its unforgivable iniquity: it did not look to the Lord and regard Him (vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v22_11>11b</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v22_14>14</a>)."
BD["i)2\x98"]="<b>Lord</b><br> &emsp; Here the Lord&rsquo;s Day should be the first day of the week, the day the Lord was resurrected (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_1>John 20:1</a>). The early church met regularly on this day (<a href=Act.htm#v20_7>Acts 20:7</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v16_2>1&nbsp;Cor. 16:2</a>). It was on this day that John was in spirit and saw the visions of God&rsquo;s economy."
