BD["i)8\x97"]="<b>stars</b><br> &emsp; Both lampstands and stars are for shining in the night. A lampstand, representing a local church, is a collective unit, whereas a star, representing a messenger of a local church, is an individual entity. In the dark night of the church&rsquo;s degradation, the shining of both the collective churches and the individual messengers is needed."

We are the joint partakers not only of His kingdom but also of His endurance (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_9>1:9</a>). Hence, His word to us today is the word of endurance. To keep the word of His endurance, we must bear His rejection and persecution."

In that they each have six wings (<a href=Rev.htm#v4_8>v. 8</a>), they are like the seraphim in <a href=Isa.htm#v6_2>Isa. 6:2</a>. (The cherubim in <a href=Exo.htm#v25_20>Exo. 25:20</a> and <a href=1Ki.htm#v6_27>1&nbsp;Kings 6:27</a> have two wings, and the cherubim in <a href=Ezk.htm#v1_6>Ezek. 1:6</a> have four wings.) They must be a combination of the cherubim and the seraphim. As the seraphim, they are for God&rsquo;s holiness (<a href=Isa.htm#v6_3>Isa. 6:3</a>), referring to God&rsquo;s nature, and as the cherubim, they are for God&rsquo;s glory (<a href=Ezk.htm#v10_18>Ezek. 10:18</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v10_19>19</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v9_5>Heb. 9:5</a>), referring to God&rsquo;s expression. Hence, they stand for God&rsquo;s nature and expression."
