BD["L)6\x97"]="<b>spirit</b><br> &emsp; For the recovery of the building of God&rsquo;s house, God&rsquo;s elect were stirred up by the Lord in their spirit in the order of God&rsquo;s authority, beginning with Zerubbabel the governor (cf. <a href=Ezr.htm#v1_5>Ezra 1:5</a>). In the Minor Prophets both the divine Spirit and the stirred-up human spirit of God&rsquo;s elect are mentioned. In the New Testament the divine Spirit has been consummated and poured out (<a href=Act.htm#v2_17>Acts 2:17</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v2_21>21</a>; <a href=Joe.htm#v2_28>Joel 2:28</a>-<a href=Joe.htm#v2_32>32</a>), and our human spirit responds to such a Spirit by being stirred up (cf. <a href=Act.htm#v17_16>Acts 17:16</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_16>Rom. 8:16</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v2_13>2&nbsp;Cor. 2:13</a>)."
BD[">U0\x97"]="<b>flow</b><br> &emsp; The clouds flowing down righteousness means that the Spirit will flow down to dispense Christ as righteousness into the people on earth, who are signified here by the earth. On the one hand, God causes the Spirit to flow down from heaven to impart Christ as righteousness into people; on the other hand, God causes people as the earth to open and bring forth salvation and righteousness, both of which are Christ Himself (<a href=Luk.htm#v2_30>Luke 2:30</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>). God carries out His salvation by using His Spirit to bring down Christ as righteousness and by opening people to receive Christ as salvation and righteousness."

BD["?P6\x97"]="<b>Gedaliah</b><br> &emsp; Although Gedaliah was faithful in caring for Jeremiah, God&rsquo;s prophet (vv. <a href=Jer.htm#v40_5>5</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v40_6>6</a>), he did not seek the Lord&rsquo;s word (vv. <a href=Jer.htm#v40_13>13</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v40_14>14</a>), because this was not his habit. He did not take God as his source to be one with Him and to receive whatever issued from Him. If he had been a person who was one with God, the first thing he would have done would have been to receive the word of God. To take, to receive, and to keep the word of God as the expression of His thought, His will, His heart&rsquo;s desire, and His good pleasure, we must be absolutely one with God. We must trust in Him, rely on Him, and not have any opinion that comes from the self. Cf. <a href=Jos.htm#v9_14>Josh. 9:14</a> and <a href=JosN.htm#n9_14x1>note</a>."

BD["M**\x97"]="<b>Jerusalem</b><br> &emsp; Whereas the temple is the sign of God&rsquo;s house, the city of Jerusalem is a sign of God&rsquo;s kingdom for His administration. The city of Jerusalem was measured and was found to be an open region (<a href=Zec.htm#v2_4>v. 4</a>), i.e., without limit. This indicates that God&rsquo;s kingdom is unlimited, the size of God Himself, and that God Himself is the size of His kingdom."

In spiritual experience, when God blows on us, His breath is the wind; when we breathe the wind, it is the breath; and when the breath is within us, it is the Spirit. When Ezekiel prophesied, God blew the wind, the people received the breath, and the breath became the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45b</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_6>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:6</a>).
