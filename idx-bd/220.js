BD["=)*\x97"]="<b>kisses</b><br> &emsp; The kisses of the mouth are the most intimate kisses. This yearning to be kissed by Christ is a response to Christ&rsquo;s cheering love, which is better than wine (<a href=SoS.htm#v1_2>v. 2b</a>), and to His charming name (equivalent to His person), which is like ointment (the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit as the realization of Christ&rsquo;s person&mdash;<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v30_23>Exo. 30:23</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v30_25>25</a> and <a href=ExoN.htm#n30_25x1>note 25<sup>1</sup></a>) poured forth with the pleasant fragrance of the anointing oils (<a href=SoS.htm#v1_3>v. 3a</a>). No one can resist Christ&rsquo;s cheering love and His charming person (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v4_18>Matt. 4:18</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v4_20>20</a>).<br> &emsp; According to vv. <a href=SoS.htm#v1_2>2</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v1_3>3</a>, the lover of Christ has obtained a part of Christ&rsquo;s love, but now she yearns for something more intimate. This indicates that the very Christ in whom we believe is personal and affectionate toward us, and that every believer&rsquo;s relationship with Christ must be personal and affectionate (<a href=Mrk.htm#v16_7>Mark 16:7</a> and <a href=MrkN.htm#n16_7x1>note</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v13_23>John 13:23</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v20_1>20:1</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v20_17>17</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20b</a>). After believing in Christ to receive Him as the divine life (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_4>John 1:4</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_12>12</a>), we need to love Christ in a personal and affectionate way that we may pursue Him and enjoy Him as our satisfaction (<a href=1Co.htm#v2_9>1&nbsp;Cor. 2:9</a> and <a href=1CoN.htm#n2_9x3>note 3</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v1_14>1&nbsp;Tim. 1:14</a> and <a href=1TiN.htm#n1_14x2>note 2</a>)."
