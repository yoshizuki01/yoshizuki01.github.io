This heavenly calling (<a href=Heb.htm#v3_1>Heb. 3:1</a>) corresponds with the heavenly commonwealth in <a href=Phi.htm#v3_20>v. 20</a>. It is not an earthly calling like that given to the children of Israel in the flesh. This upward calling is to take possession of Christ, whereas the earthly calling to the children of Israel was to take possession of the physical land."

BD["Y*9\x9a"]="<b>faith</b><br> &emsp; Faith here is all-inclusive and includes much more than the act of believing. It is the constitution and total expression of all that the believers have received, experienced, and enjoyed of Christ, including Christ as the basic offerings. Paul&rsquo;s ministry resulted in the all-inclusive faith of the believers. Such a faith was offered as a sacrifice to God by the believers, and Paul rejoiced even to be poured out as a drink offering upon such a sacrifice."
BD["S;=\x97"]="<b>purposed</b><br> &emsp; The purpose was to carry out Paul&rsquo;s loving concern for the need of the poor saints in Jerusalem. At that time Paul was in Ephesus on his third ministry journey, busy with a heavy burden to carry out his ministry in Asia (<a href=1Co.htm#v16_8>1&nbsp;Cor. 16:8</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v16_9>9</a>) and in Macedonia and Achaia (<a href=1Co.htm#v16_5>1&nbsp;Cor. 16:5</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v16_7>7</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v20_1>Acts 20:1</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v20_3>3</a>). Nonetheless, he still had a burden to spare part of his time for the needy saints in Jerusalem. When he arrived in Corinth, he wrote his Epistle to the saints in Rome, expressing the purpose of his trip and begging them to pray for him concerning this purpose (<a href=Rom.htm#v15_25>Rom. 15:25</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v15_31>31</a>). Although he was an apostle set apart by God for the Gentiles (<a href=Act.htm#v22_21>22:21</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v2_8>Gal. 2:8</a>), Paul was still concerned for the Lord&rsquo;s interest among the Jews. His primary concern was for the Body of Christ universally, not merely for his part of the New Testament ministry among the Gentiles.<br> &emsp; Besides this, his purpose in going to Jerusalem at this juncture might also have been to fellowship with James and the other apostles and elders in Jerusalem regarding the Judaic influence on the church there. According to Paul&rsquo;s teachings in the Epistles to the Galatians and the Romans, the decision made by the conference of the apostles and elders in <a href=Act.htm#v15>ch. 15</a> to resolve the problem concerning circumcision must not have been fully satisfactory to him. This undoubtedly troubled him because of his concern for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which is to build up the Body of Christ. James&rsquo;s word in <a href=Act.htm#v21_20>21:20</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v21_22>22</a>, after Paul had arrived in Jerusalem (<a href=Act.htm#v21_17>21:17</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v21_18>18</a>), and his proposal that Paul participate in the four Jewish believers&rsquo; Nazarite vow (<a href=Act.htm#v21_23>21:23</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v21_24>24</a>) seem to confirm this view."

In the godless walk of the nations, the fallen people, there is vanity. But in the godly life of Jesus there is truth, reality. Jesus lived a life in which He did everything in God, with God, and for God. God was in His living, and He was one with God. This is what is meant by the reality is in Jesus.

Its equivalent in Latin is Calvaria, anglicized as Calvary (<a href=Luk.htm#v23_33>Luke 23:33</a>, KJV). It does not mean a place of dead men&rsquo;s skulls, but simply skull."
BD["Y)=\x97"]="<b>live</b><br> &emsp; Paul&rsquo;s life was to live Christ. To him to live was Christ, not the law or circumcision. He would not live the law but would live Christ, not be found in the law but be found in Christ (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_9>3:9</a>). Christ was not only his life but also his living. He lived Christ because Christ lived in him (<a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20</a>). He was one with Christ in both life and living. He and Christ had one life and one living. They lived together as one person. Christ lived within Paul as Paul&rsquo;s life, and Paul lived Christ without as Christ&rsquo;s living.

BD["X.6\x9a"]="<b>put</b><br> &emsp; To put on the breastplate of righteousness is to cover our conscience, signified by the breast. Satan is the one who accuses us. In fighting against him we need a conscience void of offense. Regardless of how clear we feel our conscience is, it needs to be covered with the breastplate of righteousness. To be righteous is to be right with both God and man. If we are just a little wrong with either God or man, Satan will accuse us, and there will be holes in our conscience through which all our faith and boldness will leak out. Hence, we need the covering of righteousness to protect us from the enemy&rsquo;s accusation. Such righteousness is Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>)."
