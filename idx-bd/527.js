It is similar to what was prophesied in <a href=Isa.htm#v42_2>Isa. 42:2</a> concerning His quiet character. He wanted His work to be done within the limits of a move that was absolutely according to God&rsquo;s purpose and that was not promoted by man&rsquo;s excitement and propaganda.

The fig tree was the symbol of the nation of Israel (<a href=Jer.htm#v24_2>Jer. 24:2</a>, <a href=Jer.htm#v24_5>5</a>, <a href=Jer.htm#v24_8>8</a>), and the temple was the center of Israel&rsquo;s relationship with God. As a fig tree planted by God, the nation of Israel did not bear fruit for Him, and as the center of Israel&rsquo;s relationship with God, the temple was filled with corruption. Hence, the Slave-Savior cursed the fruitless fig tree and cleansed the contaminated temple. Such a dealing can be considered a harbinger of the destruction foretold in <a href=Mrk.htm#v12_9>12:9</a> and <a href=Mrk.htm#v13_2>13:2</a>."
