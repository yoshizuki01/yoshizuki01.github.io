When Job cursed the day of his birth, equivalent to cursing his mother, he surely was not perfect and upright, nor did he hold his integrity.

God&rsquo;s intention was also to tear down the natural Job in his perfection and uprightness that He might build up a renewed Job in God&rsquo;s nature and attributes. God&rsquo;s intention was not to have a Job in the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but a Job in the line of the tree of life (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>Gen. 2:9</a>).

Such a man of God, constituted with God according to His economy, would never be entangled by any troubles and problems so that he would curse his birth and prefer to die rather than to live.
