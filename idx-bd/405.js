BD["i*:\x97"]="<b>Thyatira</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means sacrifice of perfume, or unceasing sacrifice. As a sign, the church in Thyatira prefigures the Roman Catholic Church, which was fully formed as the apostate church by the establishing of the universal papal system in the latter part of the sixth century. This apostate church is full of sacrifices, as demonstrated in her continual Masses."

Hence, only he himself knows the meaning of that name."

BD["B*K\x99"]="<b>mountain</b><br> &emsp; The great mountain here signifies the eternal kingdom of God, which will fill the whole earth forever (<a href=Dan.htm#v2_44>v. 44</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v7_13>7:13</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v7_14>14</a>). After coming to crush the aggregate of human government, the corporate Christ&mdash;Christ with His overcoming bride&mdash;will become a great mountain to fill the whole earth, making the whole earth God&rsquo;s kingdom. Thus the great human image will be replaced with the eternal kingdom of God on earth (<a href=Rev.htm#v11_15>Rev. 11:15</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v11_17>17</a>).<br> &emsp; The increase of the stone into a great mountain signifies the increase of Christ (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v3_29>John 3:29</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_30>30</a>). The church is Christ&rsquo;s increase in life, but the eternal kingdom of God is Christ&rsquo;s increase in administration (<a href=Mrk.htm#v4_26>Mark 4:26</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v4_29>29</a>). Hence, Christ is not only the church but also the kingdom of God (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_12>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:12</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v17_21>Luke 17:21</a>). As the stone, Christ is the centrality of God&rsquo;s move, and as the mountain, He is the universality. Hence, He is the all-inclusive One, the One who fills all in all (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>Eph. 1:23</a>)."
