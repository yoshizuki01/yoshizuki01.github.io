BD["W+E\x97"]="<b>Abraham</b><br> &emsp; Abraham has only one seed, Christ (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_16>v. 16</a>). Hence, to be Abraham&rsquo;s seed we must be of Christ, be a part of Christ. Because we are one with Christ, we too are Abraham&rsquo;s seed, heirs according to promise, inheriting God&rsquo;s promised blessing, which is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed God, who is our portion. Under the new testament, the believers as God&rsquo;s chosen people, being sons of full age, are such heirs, not under law but in Christ. Like Ishmael (<a href=Gal.htm#v4_23>4:23</a>), the Judaizers, who remained under law and kept themselves apart from Christ, were Abraham&rsquo;s descendants according to the flesh; they were not like Isaac (<a href=Gal.htm#v4_28>4:28</a>), who was Abraham&rsquo;s heir according to promise. But the believers in Christ are such heirs, inheriting the promised blessing. Hence, we should remain in Christ and not turn to the law.<br> &emsp; Since the law is unable to give us life (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_21>v. 21</a>), it cannot produce the sons of God; but the Spirit, who is received out of faith (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_2>v. 2</a>) and who gives us life (<a href=2Co.htm#v3_6>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:6</a>), can. The law kept God&rsquo;s chosen people under its custody until faith came (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_23>v. 23</a>). Faith in Christ, who is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, makes God&rsquo;s chosen people Abraham&rsquo;s seed as &ldquo;the stars of the heavens&rdquo; (<a href=Gen.htm#v22_17>Gen. 22:17</a>) according to God&rsquo;s promise."
BD["S=3\x97"]="<b>says</b><br> &emsp; Again, the Holy Spirit told Paul beforehand, indirectly through a member of the Body of Christ, what would befall Paul in Jerusalem (see <a href=ActN.htm#n20_23x1>note 23<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Act.htm#v20>ch. 20</a>). This was again a warning in the nature of a prophecy, not a charge. It was again the Head speaking through His Body (see <a href=ActN.htm#n21_4x1>note 4<sup>1</sup></a>). Since Paul practiced the Body life, he should have listened to this speaking."

Paul lived a crucified life continually, a life under the cross, just as Christ did in His human living. Through such a life the resurrection power of Christ is experienced and expressed. The mold of Christ&rsquo;s death refers to Christ&rsquo;s experience of continually putting to death His human life that He might live by the life of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_57>John 6:57</a>). Our life should be conformed to such a mold by our dying to our human life to live the divine life. Being conformed to the death of Christ is the condition for knowing and experiencing Him, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings."
BD["Y*5\x9a"]="<b>willing</b><br> &emsp; The willing is within; the working is without. The willing takes place in our will, indicating that God&rsquo;s operation begins from our spirit (cf. <a href=Phi.htm#v4_23>4:23</a>) and spreads into our mind, emotion, and will. This corresponds with <a href=Rom.htm#v8>Rom. 8</a>, where we see that God works from our spirit (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_4>Rom. 8:4</a>), through our mind (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_6>Rom. 8:6</a>), and eventually into our physical body (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_11>Rom. 8:11</a>)."
BD["X.3\x97"]="<b>Put</b><br> &emsp; On the positive side, in the first five chapters the church is portrayed in many ways for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. On the negative side, the church is seen here as a warrior for the defeating of God&rsquo;s enemy, the devil. To defeat God&rsquo;s enemy, we need to put on the whole armor of God. &ldquo;Put on&rdquo; is an imperative, a command. God has provided the armor for us, but He does not put it on for us. Rather, we ourselves must put it on, exercising our will to cooperate with Him."

The apostle expected the Corinthian believers to do good, but not so that the apostles would appear approved. To edify the believers to do good is for the truth, but for the apostles to cause themselves to appear approved and to defend themselves to the believers (<a href=2Co.htm#v12_19>12:19</a>) is against the truth.

In his prayer the apostle prayed that the Father would strengthen the saints according to the riches of His glory. This implies that the glory of God can be wrought into the saints. In the doxology he said, &ldquo;To Him be the glory&rdquo; (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_21>v. 21</a>), implying that the glory of God, which has been wrought into the saints, returns to God. First, the glory of God is wrought into us; then it returns to God for His glorification. Isaac&rsquo;s wealth was first given to Rebekah for her beautification; then all the wealth came back to Isaac, with Rebekah, for his glorification (<a href=Gen.htm#v24_47>Gen. 24:47</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v24_53>53</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v24_61>61</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v24_67>67</a>). The apostle prayed that God would strengthen the saints according to His glory, &ldquo;but&rdquo; eventually God&rsquo;s glory, after being wrought into them, returns to Him along with the strengthened saints. This is the way in which God is glorified in the church."

In the case of the house of Cornelius, the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s entering into the believers essentially for life and falling upon them economically for power occurred simultaneously when they believed in the Lord. However, only His falling upon them economically is noted here, because it was outward and could be realized by others through their speaking in tongues and magnifying God (<a href=Act.htm#v10_46>v. 46</a>). His entering into them occurred silently and invisibly. They received both aspects of the Holy Spirit directly from Christ the Head, without any mediatorial channel, before they were baptized in water by other members of the Body of Christ. This indicates emphatically that the spreading of the gospel of the kingdom of God to the Gentiles was of the Lord, and that the Head of the Body baptized the Gentile believers into His Body directly, without the laying on of hands of any member of His Body, in contrast to the cases of the Samaritan believers and Saul of Tarsus (<a href=Act.htm#v8_17>8:17</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v9_17>9:17</a>)."
