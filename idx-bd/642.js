This signifies the beauty and excellence of Christ&rsquo;s human living and daily walk. The fine flour of the meal offering was produced out of wheat that had passed through many processes, which signify the various sufferings of Christ that made Him &ldquo;a man of sorrows&rdquo; (<a href=Isa.htm#v53_3>Isa. 53:3</a>).<br> &emsp; In contrast to the burnt offering, nothing of the animal life, but only the vegetable life, is seen in the meal offering.

For this reason, the burnt offering must be a life that has blood to shed for expiation (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_22>Heb. 9:22</a>). Because we are not absolutely for God, we need Christ as our burnt offering to appease our situation with God that we may have peace with Him. Because the burnt offering is for expiation, it can be eaten only by God (<a href=Lev.htm#v1_9>v. 9</a>; <a href=Lev.htm#v6_30>6:30</a>). We are not qualified to eat it."
