BD["B)-\x97"]="<b>choice</b><br> &emsp; Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s devilish temptation was first to seduce the four brilliant young descendants of God&rsquo;s defeated elect, Daniel and his three companions, to be defiled by partaking of his unclean food, food offered to idols. The king&rsquo;s choice provision was defiling, unclean, for it had been offered to Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s gods. For Daniel and his companions to eat that food would have been to take in the defilement, to take in the idols, and thus to become one with Satan (cf. <a href=1Co.htm#v10_19>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:19</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v10_21>21</a>). In principle, this was a temptation to eat the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which joins man to Satan (cf. <a href=Gen.htm#v3_1>Gen. 3:1</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v3_6>6</a>). When Daniel and his companions refused to eat Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s unclean food and chose instead to eat vegetables (vv. <a href=Dan.htm#v1_8>8</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v1_16>16</a>), in principle they rejected the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and took the tree of life, which caused them to be one with God (cf. <a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>Gen. 2:9</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v2_16>16</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_17>17</a>)."
