In this chapter Isaiah couples Christ as the sprout and the branch (<a href=Isa.htm#v11_1>v. 1</a>) with Christ as the banner and the standard. When Christ as a sprout grows among God&rsquo;s people, this growing-up sprout becomes a banner, which describes, explains, designates, and even gives instructions to the peoples of the earth concerning what Christ is to God&rsquo;s people.

Out of His Spirit is an expression that implies that the Spirit of God, whom God has given to us, is bountiful and without measure (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_19>Phil. 1:19</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_34>John 3:34</a>).
