BD["].4\x98"]="<b>eternal</b><br> &emsp; I.e., the divine life, the uncreated life of God, which is eternal. Eternal denotes the nature more than the time element of the divine life. To fight the good fight of the faith in the Christian life, and especially in the Christian ministry, we need to lay hold on this divine life, not trusting in our human life. Hence, in 1 and 2&nbsp;Timothy and Titus, eternal life is stressed again and again (<a href=1Ti.htm#v1_16>1:16</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v6_19>6:19</a>; <a href=2Ti.htm#v1_1>2&nbsp;Tim. 1:1</a>, <a href=2Ti.htm#v1_10>10</a>; <a href=Tit.htm#v1_2>Titus 1:2</a>; <a href=Tit.htm#v3_7>3:7</a>). To carry out God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church, as seen in 1&nbsp;Timothy, to confront the downward trend of the church&rsquo;s decline, as seen in 2&nbsp;Timothy, and to maintain good order in the church, as seen in Titus, this life is a prerequisite."
