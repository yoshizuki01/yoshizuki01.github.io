BD["R/*\x97"]="<b>Feast</b><br> &emsp; In the scene of the case in <a href=Joh.htm#v6>ch. 6</a> there was the Feast of the Passover. In the scene of this case in <a href=Joh.htm#v7>ch. 7</a> there is the Feast of Tabernacles. The Feast of the Passover is the first of the Jewish annual feasts, and the Feast of Tabernacles is the last (<a href=Lev.htm#v23_5>Lev. 23:5</a>, <a href=Lev.htm#v23_34>34</a>). The Feast of the Passover, being the first feast of the year, implies the beginning of man&rsquo;s life (cf. <a href=Exo.htm#v12_2>Exo. 12:2</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v12_3>3</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v12_6>6</a>), which involves man&rsquo;s seeking for satisfaction and results in man&rsquo;s hunger. The Feast of Tabernacles, being the last feast of the year, implies the completion and success of man&rsquo;s life (cf. <a href=Exo.htm#v23_16>Exo. 23:16</a>), which will end and will result in man&rsquo;s thirst. In the scene of the Feast of the Passover, the Lord presented Himself as the bread of life, which satisfies man&rsquo;s hunger. In the scene of the Feast of Tabernacles, the Lord promised that He would flow forth the living water, which quenches man&rsquo;s thirst.<br> &emsp; After the full harvest of their crops, the Jewish people observed the Feast of Tabernacles to worship God and enjoy what they had reaped (<a href=Deu.htm#v16_13>Deut. 16:13</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v16_15>15</a>). Hence, this feast signifies the completion, achievement, and success in man&rsquo;s career, man&rsquo;s study, and other matters of human life, including religion, with the joy and enjoyment thereof.<br> &emsp; God ordained the Feast of Tabernacles so that the children of Israel would remember how their fathers, while wandering in the wilderness, had lived in tents (<a href=Lev.htm#v23_39>Lev. 23:39</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v23_43>43</a>), expecting to enter into the rest of the good land. Hence, this feast is a reminder that today people are still in the wilderness and need to enter into the rest of the New Jerusalem, which is the eternal tabernacle (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>Rev. 21:2</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>3</a>). Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob also lived in tents and looked forward to this eternal tabernacle (<a href=Heb.htm#v11_9>Heb. 11:9</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v11_10>10</a>), in which there will be a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to quench man&rsquo;s thirst (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>Rev. 22:1</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_17>17</a>). At the end of such a feast, which had such a background, Christ cried out the promise of the rivers of living water, which will satisfy man&rsquo;s expectation for eternity (vv. <a href=Joh.htm#v7_37>37</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v7_39>39</a>)."

BD["\\)))o0"]="<b>I.</b>&nbsp; Introduction"
BD["R+6\x97"]="<b>serpent</b><br> &emsp; This chapter deals with regeneration. Regeneration, on one hand, brings the divine life with the divine nature into us. On the other hand, regeneration terminates the evil nature of Satan in our flesh. In <a href=Gen.htm#v3>Gen. 3</a> Satan, the serpent, injected his nature into man&rsquo;s flesh. When the children of Israel sinned against God, they were bitten by serpents (<a href=Num.htm#v21_4>Num. 21:4</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v21_9>9</a>). God told Moses to lift up a bronze serpent on their behalf for God&rsquo;s judgment, that by looking upon that bronze serpent all might live. That was a type. Here, in this verse, the Lord Jesus applied that type to Himself, indicating that when He was in the flesh, He was in &ldquo;the likeness of the flesh of sin&rdquo; (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_3>Rom. 8:3</a>), which likeness is equal to the form of the bronze serpent. The bronze serpent had the form of the serpent but was without the serpent&rsquo;s poison. Christ was made in &ldquo;the likeness of the flesh of sin,&rdquo; but He did not participate in any way in the sin of the flesh (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_21>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:21</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v4_15>Heb. 4:15</a>). When He was lifted up in the flesh on the cross, by His death Satan, the old serpent, was dealt with (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_31>12:31</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v12_33>33</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v2_14>Heb. 2:14</a>). This means that the serpentine nature within fallen man has been dealt with. When a man is regenerated with the divine life in Christ, his satanic nature is annulled. Because of this, in this portion of the Word, when the Lord revealed the matter of regeneration to Nicodemus, He specifically mentioned this point.<br> &emsp; Nicodemus might have considered himself a moral and good man. But the Lord&rsquo;s word in this verse implied that regardless of how good Nicodemus might have been outwardly, he had the serpentine nature of Satan inwardly. As a descendant of Adam, he had been poisoned by the old serpent, and the serpent&rsquo;s nature was within him. He needed the Lord not only to be the Lamb of God to take away his sin (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>1:29</a>) but also to be in the form of the serpent that his serpentine nature might be dealt with on the cross and that he might have eternal life. In the principle set forth in <a href=Joh.htm#v2>ch. 2</a>, this is the changing of death into life."
