BD["(-)\x97"]="<b>generations</b><br> &emsp; The genealogy recorded in this chapter includes the first ten generations of mankind, from Adam to Noah. According to <a href=Luk.htm#v3_23>Luke 3:23</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v3_38>38</a>, human genealogy began with God and issued in Jesus Christ.<br> &emsp; The history in the entire Old Testament is the Triune God&rsquo;s preparation for the carrying out of His eternal economy. This preparation was initiated in a man, Adam (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_1>1:1</a>&mdash;<a href=Gen.htm#v11_26>11:26</a>), and eventually issued in three persons, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph (<a href=Gen.htm#v11_27>11:27</a>&mdash;<a href=Gen.htm#v50_26>50:26</a>), who resulted in one people, Israel (Exo.&mdash;Mal.). The thirty-nine books of the Old Testament reveal the preparation for bringing forth Christ, the God-man, the complete God mingled with the perfect man (<a href=Mat.htm#v1>Matt. 1</a>), for the producing of the Body of Christ (<a href=Eph.htm#v1>Eph. 1</a>&mdash;<a href=Eph.htm#v4>4</a>), the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_4>Eph. 4:4</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v4_6>6</a>). The Body of Christ will consummate in the New Jerusalem (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_1>Rev. 21:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_23>23</a>) as the eternal enlargement of Christ (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v3_30>John 3:30</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v12_12>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:12</a>), the eternal mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man and the mutual dwelling of God and man (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>Rev. 21:3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_22>22</a>) for the expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in His nature and glory (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_18>Rev. 21:18b</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_21>21b</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_10>10</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_11>11</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_23>23</a>) in the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man for eternity."
BD[">Y0\x8c"]="Thus says Jehovah, / In an acceptable time I have answered You, / And in a day of salvation I have helped You; / And I will preserve You and give You for a covenant of the people, / To restore the land, to apportion the desolate inheritances,"
BD["(,,\x97"]="<b>offering</b><br> &emsp; According to <a href=Heb.htm#v11_4>Heb. 11:4</a>, Abel&rsquo;s offering, a sacrifice, was offered to God by faith. Faith comes by hearing the word of the gospel (<a href=Rom.htm#v10_17>Rom. 10:17</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v10_14>14</a>). This indicates that Abel&rsquo;s parents, Adam and Eve, must have proclaimed to their children the glad tidings that God had announced to them (<a href=Gen.htm#v3_15>3:15</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v3_21>21</a>). Like his father and mother, Abel believed the gospel and presented his offering to God according to God&rsquo;s revelation in the word proclaimed by his parents. Thus, the first family on earth was a family of the gospel, a family of believers.<br> &emsp; Abel was the first priest of God, representing all the believers in Christ (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_9>9</a>). In type, Abel offered Christ to God. According to <a href=Num.htm#v18_17>Num. 18:17</a>, the firstling of a cow or sheep or goat, a type of Christ, had to be offered to God. This offering included the sprinkling of the blood upon the altar for redemption and the burning of the fat as a satisfying fragrance to God. Hence, Abel&rsquo;s offering, corresponding exactly with what was later revealed in the Mosaic law, proves that his way of worshipping God was according to God&rsquo;s divine revelation, not according to his own concept."
BD[">X3\x8c"]="For My own sake, yes, for My own sake, I will do it, / For how can My name be profaned? / And I will not give My glory to another."
BD["(+/\x97"]="<b>And</b><br> &emsp; The dreadful result of man&rsquo;s first fall was manifold. First, man transgressed God&rsquo;s commandment (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_17>2:17</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v5_14>Rom. 5:14</a>) and thus fell under God&rsquo;s condemnation (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_16>Rom. 5:16</a>) and came under a curse (vv. <a href=Gen.htm#v3_17>17</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v3_19>19</a>). He also became estranged from God (<a href=Gen.htm#v3_8>v. 8</a>) and alienated from the life of God (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_18>Eph. 4:18</a>) in the tree of life (vv. <a href=Gen.htm#v3_23>23</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v3_24>24</a>). Not only so, in the fall Satan&rsquo;s evil thought, feeling, and will were injected into man&rsquo;s mind, emotion, and will, thus contaminating man&rsquo;s soul (vv. <a href=Gen.htm#v3_1>1</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v3_4>4</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v3_6>6</a>). Through man&rsquo;s eating of the tree of knowledge, Satan entered man&rsquo;s body and became the very sin within man (cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v7_8>Rom. 7:8</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v7_11>11</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v7_17>17</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v7_20>20</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n7_8x1>note 8<sup>1</sup></a>). Thus the human body, which was created pure and sinless, was transmuted into the flesh of sin (<a href=Rom.htm#v7_18>Rom. 7:18a</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n7_18x2>note 2</a>). As a consequence of the fall man&rsquo;s spirit was deadened (cf. <a href=Eph.htm#v2_1>Eph. 2:1</a>, <a href=Eph.htm#v2_5>5</a> and <a href=EphN.htm#n2_1x2>note 1<sup>2</sup></a>), becoming insulated from God and losing its function toward God. Hence, each of man&rsquo;s three parts&mdash;his body, his soul, and his spirit&mdash;was damaged by the fall. Furthermore, fallen man was constituted a sinner (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_19>Rom. 5:19</a>) and became a victim of death (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_12>Rom. 5:12b</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v5_14>14a</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v15_22>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:22a</a>). Consequently, man was spoiled from fulfilling God&rsquo;s purpose, which is to express God in His image and represent God with His dominion (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_26>1:26</a>). Finally, because of man&rsquo;s fall all the creation is subjected to vanity and the slavery of corruption (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_20>Rom. 8:20</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_21>21</a>)."
