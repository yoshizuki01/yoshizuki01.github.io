BD[")FJ\x97"]="<b>spices</b><br> &emsp; The three fragrant spices signify the Triune God in resurrection (the number three signifies both the Triune God and resurrection), and the addition of pure frankincense, making the number of ingredients four, signifies the humanity of Christ (the number four signifies man as God&rsquo;s creature&mdash;<a href=Ezk.htm#v1_5>Ezek. 1:5</a>). The compounding of the four ingredients into one incense signifies the mingling of God with man, of divinity with humanity, in Christ as the incense. Each of the three spices signifies the death of Christ, as follows: (1) stacte, a kind of myrrh, a resinous gum produced by a tree, signifies the sweet death of Christ&rsquo;s generating life (signified by the plant life&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v12_24>John 12:24</a>); (2) onycha, the shell of a small animal that grows in the marshes of the Red Sea, signifies the death of Christ with His redemptive life (signified by the animal life&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>John 1:29</a>); and (3) galbanum, also a resinous gum from a tree, signifies the powerful death of Christ&rsquo;s generating life. The disagreeable and offensive odor of galbanum strengthened the fragrance of the other spices and caused the fragrance of the incense to remain and endure. Galbanum was used to repel noxious insects and poisonous reptiles, including serpents. The second of the spices, being of the animal life, signifies that the second of the Godhead was slain to accomplish redemption. Hence, the three spices indicate that Christ&rsquo;s death in His generating life and His redeeming life has three functions: to generate us as sons of God, to redeem us from the fall, and to expel the serpent, the Devil (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v12_24>John 12:24</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_18>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:18</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_19>19</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v2_14>Heb. 2:14</a>). The fourth ingredient, frankincense, is a white resinous gum, signifying the sweet resurrection of Christ. The three spices and the frankincense are seasoned with salt (<a href=Exo.htm#v30_35>v. 35</a>), making the number of ingredients five, the number five signifying responsibility (<a href=Mat.htm#v24_2>Matt. 24:2</a>).

BD["U/P\x98"]="<b>also</b><br> &emsp; In <a href=1Co.htm#v7_10>v. 10</a> the apostle said, &ldquo;I charge, not I but the Lord.&rdquo; In <a href=1Co.htm#v7_12>v. 12</a> he said, &ldquo;I say, I, not the Lord.&rdquo; In <a href=1Co.htm#v7_25>v. 25</a> he said, &ldquo;I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion.&rdquo; Here he says, &ldquo;according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&rdquo; All these words indicate the New Testament principle of incarnation (that is, that God and man, man and God, become one). This differs drastically from the principle of Old Testament prophecy (that is, that man speaks for God). In the Old Testament the word of Jehovah came upon a prophet (<a href=Jer.htm#v1_2>Jer. 1:2</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v1_3>Ezek. 1:3</a>), the prophet being simply the mouthpiece of God. But in the New Testament the Lord becomes one with His apostles, and they become one with Him; thus, the two speak together. His word becomes their word, and whatever they utter is His word. Hence, the apostle&rsquo;s charge was the Lord&rsquo;s charge (<a href=1Co.htm#v7_10>v. 10</a>). What he said, though it was not spoken by the Lord, still became part of the divine revelation in the New Testament (<a href=1Co.htm#v7_12>v. 12</a>). He was one with the Lord to such a degree that even when he gave his own opinion, not the commandment of the Lord (<a href=1Co.htm#v7_25>v. 25</a>), he thought that he also had the Spirit of God. He did not claim definitely to have the Spirit of God, but he thought that he also had the Spirit of God. This is the highest spirituality; it is based on the principle of incarnation."
