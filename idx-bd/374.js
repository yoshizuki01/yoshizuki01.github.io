All during the apostle&rsquo;s long and unfortunate imprisonment-voyage, the Lord kept the apostle in His ascendancy and enabled him to live a life far beyond the realm of anxiety. This life was fully dignified, with the highest standard of human virtues expressing the most excellent divine attributes, a life that resembled the one that the Lord Himself had lived on the earth years before. This was Jesus living again on the earth in His divinely enriched humanity! This was the wonderful, excellent, and mysterious God-man, who lived in the Gospels, continuing to live in the Acts through one of His many members! This was a living witness of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and God-exalted Christ! Paul in his voyage lived and magnified Christ (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_20>Phil. 1:20</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>21</a>). It is no wonder that the people honored him and his companions with many honors (<a href=Act.htm#v28_10>v. 10</a>), that is, with the greatest respect and highest regard! An ambassador sent by God should be treated by men with such respect and regard."
