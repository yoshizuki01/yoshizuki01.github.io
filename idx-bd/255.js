The cross of Christ abolished the ordinances of the law (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_15>Eph. 2:15</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v2_14>Col. 2:14</a>), and we the believers have died to philosophy, an element of the world (<a href=Col.htm#v2_20>Col. 2:20</a>). But Satan instigated the Judaizers and the Greek philosophers to preach their &ldquo;isms&rdquo; of worldly wisdom that the cross of Christ might be made void. The apostle Paul was alert in this matter. In dealing with the divisions among the Corinthian believers, which came mainly from the background of Jewish religion and Greek philosophy, the apostle stressed Christ and His cross. When Christ is taken to replace religious opinions and philosophical wisdom, and when His cross is working to deal with the flesh attached to any background, divisions will be terminated. The exaltation of natural preference and human wisdom cannot stand before Christ and His cross."
