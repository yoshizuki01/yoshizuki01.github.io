BD["e+*\x97"]="<b>it</b><br> &emsp; Since we are the children of God, we will be like Him in the maturity of life when He is manifested. To be like Him is &ldquo;what we will be.&rdquo; This has not yet been manifested. This indicates that the children of God have a great future with a more splendid blessing: we will not only have the divine nature but will also bear the divine likeness. To partake of the divine nature is already a great blessing and enjoyment, yet to be like God, bearing His likeness, will be a greater blessing and enjoyment."
BD["c*?\x97"]="<b>all</b><br> &emsp; All, inserted here, refers to all the sufferings of the Lord. The Lord kept committing all His insults and injuries to Him who judges righteously in His government, the righteous God, to whom He submitted Himself. This indicates that the Lord recognized God&rsquo;s government while He was living a human life on earth."
BD["e+)\x9a"]="<b>children</b><br> &emsp; This word corresponds with begotten of Him in the preceding verse. We have been begotten of the Father, the source of life, to be the children of God&mdash;God being the Owner of the children. We partake of the Father&rsquo;s life to express the Triune God."
BD["e*-\x97"]="<b>word</b><br> &emsp; Word is synonymous with commandments in vv. <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_3>3</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_4>4</a>. The word here comprises all the commandments. Commandments emphasizes injunction; word implies spirit and life as a supply to us (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_63>John 6:63</a>)."

BD["e)0\x97"]="<b>do</b><br> &emsp; I.e., do not have the indwelling sin (<a href=Rom.htm#v7_17>Rom. 7:17</a>) within our nature. This was what the Gnostic heresy taught. The apostle was inoculating the believers against this false teaching. This section, <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_7>1:7</a>&mdash;<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_2>2:2</a>, deals with the believers&rsquo; sinning after their regeneration. Such sinning interrupts their fellowship with God. If after regeneration the believers do not have sin in their nature, how could they sin in their conduct? Even if they sin only occasionally, not habitually, their sinning is adequate proof that they still have sin working within them. Otherwise, there would be no interruption in their fellowship with God. The apostle&rsquo;s teaching here also condemns today&rsquo;s teaching of perfectionism, which says that a state of freedom from sin is attainable or has been attained in this earthly life; and it annuls today&rsquo;s erroneous teaching of the eradication of the sinful nature, which, misinterpreting the word in <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_9>3:9</a> and <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_18>5:18</a>, says that regenerated persons cannot sin because their sinful nature has been totally eradicated."
BD["e)/\x9a"]="<b>Jesus</b><br> &emsp; The name Jesus denotes the Lord&rsquo;s humanity, which is needed for the shedding of the redeeming blood, and the title His Son denotes the Lord&rsquo;s divinity, which is needed for the eternal efficacy of the redeeming blood. Thus, the blood of Jesus His Son indicates that this blood is the proper blood of a genuine man shed for the redeeming of God&rsquo;s fallen creatures, with the divine surety as its eternal efficacy, an efficacy that is all-prevailing in space and everlasting in time.<br> &emsp; The title Jesus His Son is also used by John as an inoculation against the heresies concerning the Lord&rsquo;s person. One of the heresies insisted on the divinity of the Lord by denying His humanity. The title Jesus as the name of a man inoculates against this heresy. Another heresy insisted on the humanity of the Lord by denying His divinity. The title His Son as a name of the Deity is an antidote to this heresy."

BD["d+3\x97"]="<b>all</b><br> &emsp; All things, both in the heavens and on the earth, have been defiled by the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man. Although all things, whether on the earth or in the heavens, have been reconciled to God through Christ by His blood (<a href=Col.htm#v1_20>Col. 1:20</a> and <a href=ColN.htm#n1_20x4>note 4</a>)&mdash;even the heavenly things having been purified by the blood of Christ (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_23>Heb. 9:23</a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n9_23x1>note 1</a>)&mdash;they will still need to be cleared up by being burned up in God&rsquo;s governmental dealing, that they may become new in nature and appearance in God&rsquo;s new universe (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_13>v. 13</a>). Thus, what kind of persons ought we, the children of the holy God, to be in holy manner of life and godliness; that is, what kind of transformation ought we to experience in order to live a life in the manner of God&rsquo;s holy nature and godliness to express Him, that we may be qualified to match His holy government?"

BD["d+1\x9d"]="<b>repentance</b><br> &emsp; Repentance unto salvation (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_15>v. 15</a>), which is to repent for not being watchful for the day of the Lord&rsquo;s coming (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_10>v. 10</a>) and not living a life in a holy manner and godliness (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_11>v. 11</a>)."

BD["d)8\x9a"]="<b>eyewitnesses</b><br> &emsp; &ldquo;\x91Admitted into immediate vision of the glory,&rsquo; a word used for full initiation into the mysteries&rdquo; (Darby). Peter realized that he, James, and John had been admitted into the highest degree of initiation at the Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration, admitted to be the initiated spectators of His majesty. He considered the transfiguration of the Lord a figure of His second coming, even as the Lord did in <a href=Luk.htm#v9_26>Luke 9:26</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v9_36>36</a>. The Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration in glory was a fact, and he was in it. The Lord&rsquo;s coming back in glory also will be a fact, as real as the Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration, and he will be in it as well. This was not a cleverly devised myth told to the believers by the apostles."
BD["c-6\x97"]="<b>Peace</b><br> &emsp; Peace results from grace and issues from the enjoyment of the Triune God. Such enjoyment of God as the multiplying and multiplied grace (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_2>1:2</a>), the varied grace (<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_10>4:10</a>), the all grace (<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_10>5:10</a>), and the true grace (<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_12>5:12</a>), as the reality of the contents of the Christian life under the government of God, issues and results in a condition of peace with both God and man."
BD["c,9\x97"]="<b>judgment</b><br> &emsp; This book shows the government of God, especially in relation to His dealings with His chosen people. The sufferings they undergo in fiery persecution are used by Him as a means to judge them that they may be disciplined, purified, and separated from the unbelievers and not have the same destiny as they. Hence, such disciplinary judgment begins from His own household, and it is not exercised just once or twice but is being carried out continuously until the Lord&rsquo;s coming. See <a href=1PeN.htm#n1_17x2P2>note 17<sup>2</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=1Pe.htm#v1>ch. 1</a>."

He remains the same forever (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_11>1:11</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v1_12>12</a>). There must not be another Jesus and another gospel preached in the church (<a href=2Co.htm#v11_4>2&nbsp;Cor. 11:4</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v1_8>Gal. 1:8</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v1_9>9</a>). For a true and steadfast church life, we must hold on to the Christ who is the same yesterday and today, and even forever, and must not be carried away by various strange teachings (<a href=Heb.htm#v13_9>v. 9</a>)."
BD["a43\x97"]="<b>peaceable</b><br> &emsp; Peace is the fruit of righteousness (<a href=Isa.htm#v32_17>Isa. 32:17</a>). Holiness is the inward nature, whereas righteousness is the outward behavior.
