For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might undo and destroy the sinful deeds of the devil, that is, condemn, through His death on the cross in the flesh (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_3>Rom. 8:3</a>), sin initiated by him, the evil one; destroy the power of sin, the sinful nature of the devil (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_14>Heb. 2:14</a>); and take away both sin and sins (<a href=1JoN.htm#n3_5x1>note 5<sup>1</sup></a>)."

BD["d*=\x97"]="<b>way</b><br> &emsp; To take the way of righteousness is to live a life that is right with both God and man; it is another aspect of the way of the truth (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_2>v. 2</a> and <a href=2PeN.htm#n2_2x2>note 2</a>) and the straight way (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_15>v. 15</a> and <a href=2PeN.htm#n2_15x1>note 1</a>). This is the way of living a life according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, a way that can receive His governmental judgment (vv. <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_3>3</a>, <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_9>9</a>) for His kingdom of righteousness (<a href=Rom.htm#v14_17>Rom. 14:17</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v5_20>Matt. 5:20</a>). Peter in his Epistles stressed both the manner of life and the way of life because his writings are based on the governmental point of view of God&rsquo;s administration. To correspond with the government of Him who is holy and righteous, God&rsquo;s people need to have a manner of life that is holy, pure, good, and excellent (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_15>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:15</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v3_16>3:16</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v3_2>2</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_12>2:12</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_11>2&nbsp;Pet. 3:11</a>), not licentious and vain (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_7>v. 7</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_18>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:18</a>), in His straight way of righteousness and truth."

Since in the church life we enjoy the unchanging Christ as grace and follow Him outside religion, we should offer through Him spiritual sacrifices to God. First, in the church we should offer up through Him a sacrifice of praise to God continually. In the church He sings in us hymns of praise unto God the Father (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_12>2:12</a>). In the church we too should praise God the Father through Him. Eventually, in the church He and we, we and He, praise the Father together in the mingled spirit. He, as the life-giving Spirit, praises the Father in our spirit, and we, by our spirit, praise the Father in His Spirit. This is the best and highest sacrifice that we can offer to God through Him. This is greatly needed in the church meetings."
