It was opened to Jacob (<a href=Gen.htm#v28_12>Gen. 28:12</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v28_17>17</a>), to Ezekiel (<a href=Ezk.htm#v1_1>Ezek. 1:1</a>), to Jesus (<a href=Mat.htm#v3_16>Matt. 3:16</a>), to Stephen (<a href=Act.htm#v7_56>Acts 7:56</a>), and to Peter (<a href=Act.htm#v10_11>Acts 10:11</a>). Here and in <a href=Rev.htm#v19_11>19:11</a> it was opened to John, the writer of this book, and it will be opened to all believers in the Lord in eternity (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_51>John 1:51</a>)."

BD["i+,\x97"]="<b>defiled</b><br> &emsp; Garments in the Bible signify what we are in our walk and living. To defile one&rsquo;s garments means particularly to stain them with deadness. Death is more defiling before God than sin (<a href=Lev.htm#v11_24>Lev. 11:24</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v11_25>25</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v6_6>Num. 6:6</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v6_7>7</a>, <a href=Num.htm#v6_9>9</a>)."
BD["i*/\x97"]="<b>ear</b><br> &emsp; Although our angle and position may be right, we still may not have the proper ear to hear. <a href=Rev.htm#v1>Chapter 1</a> emphasizes seeing and chs. <a href=Rev.htm#v2>2</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v3>3</a> emphasize hearing. In spiritual things, seeing depends on hearing. The writer of this book first heard the voice (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_10>1:10</a>) and then saw the vision (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_12>1:12</a>). If our ears are dull and cannot hear, then we cannot see (<a href=Isa.htm#v6_9>Isa. 6:9</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v6_10>10</a>). The Jews would not hear the word of the Lord, so they could not see what the Lord was doing according to the new testament (<a href=Mat.htm#v13_15>Matt. 13:15</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v28_27>Acts 28:27</a>). The Lord always wants to open our ears to hear His voice (<a href=Job.htm#v33_14>Job 33:14</a>-<a href=Job.htm#v33_16>16</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v50_4>Isa. 50:4</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v50_5>5</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v21_6>Exo. 21:6</a>) that we may see things according to His economy. The dull ears need to be circumcised (<a href=Jer.htm#v6_10>Jer. 6:10</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v7_51>Acts 7:51</a>). The sinners&rsquo; ears need to be cleansed with the redeeming blood and anointed with the Spirit (<a href=Lev.htm#v14_14>Lev. 14:14</a>, <a href=Lev.htm#v14_17>17</a>, <a href=Lev.htm#v14_28>28</a>). To serve the Lord as priests, we must have our ears cleansed with the redeeming blood (<a href=Exo.htm#v29_20>Exo. 29:20</a>; <a href=Lev.htm#v8_23>Lev. 8:23</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v8_24>24</a>). According to this book, as the Spirit is speaking to the churches, we all need an opened, circumcised, cleansed, and anointed ear to hear the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking."

It is in each man bound to the spirit, man&rsquo;s higher part, and to the body, man&rsquo;s lower part; drawn upwards by the one, downwards by the other. He who gives himself up to the lower appetites, is fleshly: he who by communion of his spirit with God&rsquo;s Spirit is employed in the higher aims of his being, is spiritual. He who rests midway, thinking only of self and self&rsquo;s interests, whether animal or intellectual, is the psychikos, the selfish man, the man in whom the spirit is sunk and degraded into subordination to the subordinate psyche [soul]&rdquo; (Alford)."
BD["i)2\x97"]="<b>spirit</b><br> &emsp; This book stresses not only the Spirit of God as the sevenfold intensified Spirit for God&rsquo;s intensified move, but also our human spirit as the organ for us to realize and respond to God&rsquo;s move. Only spirit (our spirit) can respond to Spirit (God&rsquo;s Spirit). This book is composed of four major visions: (1) the vision of the churches (chs. <a href=Rev.htm#v1>1</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v3>3</a>), (2) the vision of the destiny of the world (chs. <a href=Rev.htm#v4>4</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v16>16</a>), (3) the vision of Babylon the Great (chs. <a href=Rev.htm#v17>17</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v20>20</a>), and (4) the vision of the New Jerusalem (chs. <a href=Rev.htm#v21>21</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v22>22</a>). John was in his spirit when he saw these four visions (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_10>v. 10</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v4_2>4:2</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v17_3>17:3</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_10>21:10</a>); that is, he received the revelation of the mystery of Christ in his spirit, according to what is mentioned in <a href=Eph.htm#v3_5>Eph. 3:5</a>. We too need to be in our spirit to see the visions in this book. It is a matter not merely of mental understanding in our mind but of spiritual realization in our spirit."
