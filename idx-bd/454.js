BD["=)0\x97"]="<b>Go</b><br> &emsp; In her fellowship with her Beloved, the Beloved tells her to go forth from the place where she is kept away from the proper church life and to follow Him on the footsteps of the church (flock) and pasture her spiritual children (young goats) at the local churches (the shepherds&rsquo; tents), where He pastures His church. To follow on the footsteps of the flock is to follow the church, to follow the footsteps of all the faithful seekers of Christ throughout the centuries. As we follow the church, we are led into Christ&rsquo;s presence, and we bring all the younger ones (young goats) to the church as well. The church is the place where Christ&rsquo;s presence is and where He pastures, shepherds and feeds, His saints (<a href=Joh.htm#v10_11>John 10:11</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v10_16>16</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v20_28>Acts 20:28</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v5_2>1&nbsp;Pet. 5:2</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_4>4</a>).<br> &emsp; The Lord&rsquo;s lover has been seeking Him for her own satisfaction, but the Lord&rsquo;s concern is for God&rsquo;s satisfaction realized by the accomplishing of His eternal economy. God&rsquo;s economy is to save sinners in order to gain the proper local churches, so that the essence of these churches can become the organic Body of Christ, which consummates the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God&rsquo;s economy. Hence, in His answer to His lover, Christ instructs her to enter into the church life and also charges her to take care of her spiritual children, the members of the Body of Christ."

In addition, God put eternity, an aspiration for something eternal, in man&rsquo;s heart so that man will seek God, the eternal One. Hence, temporal things can never satisfy man; only the eternal God, who is Christ, can satisfy the deep sense of purpose in man&rsquo;s heart (cf. <a href=2Co.htm#v4_18>2&nbsp;Cor. 4:18</a>).
