BD["T,)\x97"]="<b>What</b><br> &emsp; After dealing in <a href=Rom.htm#v3>ch. 3</a> with the objective, positional justification accomplished by the death of Christ, Paul in this chapter shows the subjective, dispositional justification carried out by the resurrection of Christ. He uses Abraham as the example to show that adequate, living justification is God&rsquo;s deeper work in calling fallen people out of everything other than God and bringing them back to Himself, so that they place their full trust in Him rather than in themselves. In <a href=Gen.htm#v15>Gen. 15</a> Abraham&rsquo;s being justified by God was not related to sin; rather, it was for the gaining of a seed to produce a kingdom that will inherit the world (<a href=Rom.htm#v4_13>v. 13</a>). Likewise, this chapter indicates that justification is not merely for man to be delivered out of God&rsquo;s condemnation, but even more for God to gain many sons (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>8:29</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_30>30</a>) to constitute the one Body of Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v12>ch. 12</a>) as the kingdom of God (<a href=Rom.htm#v14_17>14:17</a>) for the fulfillment of His purpose. The objective, positional justification covered in <a href=Rom.htm#v3>ch. 3</a> is related to redemption, through which man may be reconciled to God; the subjective, dispositional justification covered in <a href=Rom.htm#v4>ch. 4</a> is related to life, through which men may become heirs for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose. This requires that man&rsquo;s flesh and his natural ability be cut off, circumcised."
