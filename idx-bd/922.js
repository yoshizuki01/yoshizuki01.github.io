The contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy are composed of the &ldquo;all things which relate to life and godliness&rdquo; (<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_3>v. 3</a>), that is, the Triune God dispensing Himself into us as life within and godliness without (see points <a href=1TiN.htm#n1_1x1P2>1</a>, <a href=1TiN.htm#n1_1x1P3>2</a>, <a href=1TiN.htm#n1_1x1P5>4</a>, and <a href=1TiN.htm#n1_1x1P6>5</a> and the last paragraph of <a href=1TiN.htm#n1_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=1Ti.htm#v1>1&nbsp;Tim. 1</a>). The equally precious faith, allotted to us by God through the word of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and the Spirit, responds to the reality of such contents and ushers us into the reality, making its substance the very element of our Christian life and experience. Such a faith is allotted to all the believers in Christ as their portion, which is equally precious to all who have received it. As such a portion from God, this faith is objective to us in the divine truth. But it brings all the contents of its substantiation into us, thus making them all, with itself (faith), subjective to us in our experience. This can be compared to the scenery (truth) and the seeing (faith) being objective to the camera (us). But when the light (the Spirit) brings the scenery to the film (our spirit) within the camera, both the seeing and the scenery become subjective to the camera."
