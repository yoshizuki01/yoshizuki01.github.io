BD[">R,\x99"]="<b>justice</b><br> &emsp; Justice (vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v42_1>1</a>, <a href=Isa.htm#v42_3>3</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v42_4>4</a>) is righteousness passing through judgment. It is the verdict of the judgment on righteousness. In this book it refers to salvation as the result of God&rsquo;s judgment on Christ, the righteous One, which was executed according to God&rsquo;s righteous law and completely fulfills all the requirements of that law (cf. <a href=Gal.htm#v2_19>Gal. 2:19</a> and <a href=GalN.htm#n2_19x1>note 1</a>). To establish justice in the earth means to establish God&rsquo;s salvation as the issue of God&rsquo;s judgment on Christ. God&rsquo;s salvation is of two aspects&mdash;justification as the judicial aspect and the impartation of life as the organic aspect (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_10>Rom. 5:10</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v5_18>18</a>). God justifies and imparts life to the believers based on Christ&rsquo;s redemption accomplished through God&rsquo;s righteous judgment; this is justice. Christ will come again when He finishes the establishing of God&rsquo;s justice, God&rsquo;s salvation, in this earth."
BD["i=6\x97"]="<b>foundations</b><br> &emsp; The foundations here are not the foundation that is Christ, mentioned in <a href=1Co.htm#v3_10>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:10</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_11>11</a>. Rather, they are the twelve apostles of the Lamb. Today the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_20>Eph. 2:20</a>). Since in eternity there will be no more need for the prophets, the foundations of the holy city will consist only of the apostles."
BD["L))\x99"]="<b>Zerubbabel</b><br> &emsp; During the years when the rebuilding of the temple was interrupted through the opposition of the adversaries (<a href=Ezr.htm#v4>Ezra 4</a>), the children of Israel began to build houses for themselves and gradually forgot the building of the temple (vv. <a href=Hag.htm#v1_2>2</a>-<a href=Hag.htm#v1_4>4</a>). Haggai&rsquo;s speaking to Zerubbabel the governor, representing the kingship, and Joshua the high priest, representing the priesthood, was to strengthen and encourage them and the people for the rebuilding of the temple as God&rsquo;s house (<a href=Ezr.htm#v5_1>Ezra 5:1</a> and <a href=EzrN.htm#n5_1x1>note</a>)."
BD["i;<\x97"]="<b>cast</b><br> &emsp; Antichrist and the false prophet will be the first to be cast into the lake of fire (cf. <a href=Rev.htm#v20_10>20:10</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_15>15</a>). Unlike all the others who perish, they will be cast alive into the lake of fire, without passing through death and resurrection.<br> &emsp; At this point we can see that once the seventh trumpet is sounded, on the same day, the last day of the great tribulation, the following events will all take place: (1) the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of Christ; (2) the dead saints will be resurrected and will be raptured with the living saints; (3) the two witnesses will be resurrected and raptured; (4) Christ will execute the judgment at His judgment seat for the rewarding of the overcomers; (5) the marriage of the Lamb and the overcomers will take place; (6) Christ and His newly-wed overcomers will come to the earth to defeat Antichrist and destroy those who destroy the earth in the war at Armageddon, and to cast Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire; (7) by the war at Armageddon Christ will rescue Israel from Antichrist&rsquo;s besieging, and the whole house of Israel will repent and be saved; (8) the material Babylon the Great will be destroyed; and (9) at the same time the seven bowls will be poured out. The war at Armageddon will occur at the time of the sixth bowl. The various plagues of the seven bowls will be executed by God on the same day, perhaps at the time when the few positive events mentioned previously will occur."

BD["i>3\x97"]="<b>Let</b><br> &emsp; In the age of this book, whatever one is, whether unrighteous or righteous, whether filthy or holy, is a serious matter. To be righteous is to walk outwardly according to the righteous ways of God, whereas to be holy is to live inwardly according to the holy nature of God. In the age of this book we must walk and live in this way that we may receive the reward; otherwise, we will be condemned as unrighteous and filthy and will receive punishment at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_12>v. 12</a>)."
