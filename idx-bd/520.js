BD["e)/\x9c"]="<b>sin</b><br> &emsp; The New Testament deals with the problem of sin by using both the word sin (singular) and the word sins (plural). Sin refers to the indwelling sin, which came through Adam into mankind from Satan (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_12>Rom. 5:12</a>). It is dealt with in the second section of Romans, <a href=Rom.htm#v5_12>5:12</a>&mdash;<a href=Rom.htm#v8_13>8:13</a> (with the exception of <a href=Rom.htm#v7_5>7:5</a>, where sins is mentioned). Sins refers to the sinful deeds, the fruits of the indwelling sin, which are dealt with in the first section of Romans, <a href=Rom.htm#v1_18>1:18</a>&mdash;<a href=Rom.htm#v5_11>5:11</a>. However, in this verse sin in the singular, used with the adjective every, does not denote the indwelling sin but every single sin we commit (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_10>v. 10</a>) after we are regenerated; each such sin defiles our purged conscience and needs to be cleansed away by the blood of the Lord in our fellowship with God.<br> &emsp; Our sin, the indwelling sin in our nature (<a href=Rom.htm#v7_17>Rom. 7:17</a>), has been dealt with by Christ as our sin offering (<a href=Lev.htm#v4>Lev. 4</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v53_10>Isa. 53:10</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_3>Rom. 8:3</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v5_21>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:21</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v9_26>Heb. 9:26</a>). Our sins, our trespasses, have been dealt with by Christ as our trespass offering (<a href=Lev.htm#v5>Lev. 5</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v53_11>Isa. 53:11</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v15_3>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:3</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_24>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:24</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v9_28>Heb. 9:28</a>). However, after our regeneration we still need to take Christ as our sin offering for the sin in our nature as indicated in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_8>v. 8</a>, and as our trespass offering for the sins in our conduct as indicated in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_9>v. 9</a>."
