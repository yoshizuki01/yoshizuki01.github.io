The thought is not extinction but ruin, loss (not of being but of well-being). In <a href=Mat.htm#v10_28>Matt. 10:28</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v22_7>22:7</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v12_9>Mark 12:9</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v17_27>Luke 17:27</a>, <a href=Luk.htm#v17_29>29</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_16>John 3:16</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v10_28>10:28</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v17_12>17:12</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v10_9>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:9</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v10_10>10</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v2_15>2&nbsp;Cor. 2:15</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v4_3>4:3</a>; <a href=2Th.htm#v2_10>2&nbsp;Thes. 2:10</a>; and <a href=Jud.htm#v5>Jude 5</a>, <a href=Jud.htm#v11>11</a>, this word unveils more concerning God&rsquo;s governmental judgment. In <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_9>3:9</a> it denotes the punishment of God&rsquo;s governmental discipline.<br> &emsp; (2) Apoleia, akin to apollumi, indicates loss (of well-being, not of being), ruin, destruction, or (physical, spiritual, or eternal) perdition. It is rendered destructive and destruction in <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_1>2:1</a>, and destruction in <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_3>2:3</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_7>3:7</a>, <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_16>16</a>.

Here, in his second Epistle, he unveiled to them the energy, the strength, by which they were enabled to escape the corruption in lust, and the result of that escape. The energy is the virtue of the divine life, and the result is that the believers partake of the divine nature of God and thus enjoy all the riches of what the Triune God is. In our partaking of the divine nature and in our enjoying of all that God is, all the riches of the divine nature will be fully developed, as described in vv. <a href=2Pe.htm#v1_5>5</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_7>7</a>.
