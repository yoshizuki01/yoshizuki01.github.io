BD["^,>\x97"]="<b>spirit</b><br> &emsp; This book, which gives instructions on how to confront the degradation of the church, strongly stresses our spirit. In the beginning it emphasizes that a strong, loving, and sound spirit was given to us, a spirit by which we can fan the gift of God into flame and suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God and the Lord&rsquo;s life-imparting grace (<a href=2Ti.htm#v1_6>1:6</a>-<a href=2Ti.htm#v1_10>10</a>). In the conclusion it blesses us by emphasizing the Lord&rsquo;s being with our spirit that we may enjoy Him as grace in order to stand against the downward current of the church&rsquo;s decline and carry out God&rsquo;s economy through His indwelling Spirit (<a href=2Ti.htm#v1_14>1:14</a>) and equipping word (<a href=2Ti.htm#v3_16>3:16</a>-<a href=2Ti.htm#v3_17>17</a>)."
BD["a)+\x9a"]="<b>sat</b><br> &emsp; This book, having the concept that all positive things are heavenly, points us to the very Christ who is in the heavens. In the Gospels is the Christ who lived on the earth and died on the cross for the accomplishing of redemption. In the Acts is the resurrected and ascended Christ propagated and ministered to men. In Romans is the Christ who is our righteousness for justification and our life for sanctification, transformation, conformation, glorification, and building up. In Galatians is the Christ who enables us to live a life that is versus the law, religion, tradition, and forms. In Philippians is the Christ who is lived out of His members. In Ephesians and Colossians is the Christ who is the life, the content, and the Head of the Body, the church. In 1 and 2&nbsp;Corinthians is the Christ who is everything in the practical church life. In 1 and 2&nbsp;Thessalonians is the Christ who is our holiness for His coming back. In 1 and 2&nbsp;Timothy and Titus is the Christ who is God&rsquo;s economy, enabling us to know how to conduct ourselves in the house of God. In the Epistles of Peter is the Christ who enables us to take God&rsquo;s governmental dealings administered through sufferings. In the Epistles of John is the Christ who is the life and fellowship of the children of God in God&rsquo;s family. In Revelation is the Christ who is walking among the churches in this age, ruling over the world in the kingdom in the coming age, and expressing God in full glory in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. In this book is the present Christ, who is now in the heavens as our Minister (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_2>8:2</a>) and our High Priest (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_14>4:14</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v4_15>15</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v7_26>7:26</a>), ministering to us the heavenly life, grace, authority, and power and sustaining us to live a heavenly life on earth. He is the Christ now, the Christ today, and the Christ on the throne in the heavens, who is our daily salvation and moment-by-moment supply."
