This signifies that a considerable portion of Christ&rsquo;s excellent, perfect, Spirit-filled, and resurrection-saturated living is offered to God as food for His enjoyment. This portion is so satisfying to God that it becomes a memorial. The remainder of the offering, consisting of fine flour and oil but no frankincense, was food for the serving priests (vv. <a href=Lev.htm#v2_3>3</a>, <a href=Lev.htm#v2_10>10</a>).<br> &emsp; Whereas the burnt offering is God&rsquo;s food for His satisfaction (<a href=Num.htm#v28_2>Num. 28:2</a>), the meal offering is our food for our satisfaction, a portion also being shared with God. Proper worship is a matter of satisfying God with Christ as the burnt offering and of being satisfied with Christ as the meal offering and sharing this satisfaction with God (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v4_24>John 4:24</a> and <a href=JohN.htm#n4_24x4>note 4</a>)."
