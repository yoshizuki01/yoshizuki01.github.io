To touch this living God we need to exercise our spirit (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_12>4:12</a>) and have a blood-purified conscience in our spirit."

He also advises them to remember their Creator while they are young and not hesitate in doing this until old age comes (<a href=Ecc.htm#v12_1>12:1</a>)."

BD["c,8\x8c"]="But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name."
BD["?,+\x97"]="<b>fallow</b><br> &emsp; Israel should sow everything in the presence of God, with God, and for God. This is to use the land properly. Instead they worshipped idols and sowed among thorns. Thus, God advised them to stop that kind of sowing and return to the fallow ground in which they should have been sowing."
BD[":\x9fP\x8c"]="Behold, I have longed after Your precepts; / Enliven me in Your righteousness."
BD["a5/\x8c"]="Remember the ones leading you, who have spoken to you the word of God; and considering the issue of their manner of life, imitate their faith."
BD["c-1\x98"]="<b>faith</b><br> &emsp; Your faith refers to the believers&rsquo; subjective faith, their faith in God&rsquo;s protecting power and loving concern."

BD["?+.\x97"]="<b>Israel</b><br> &emsp; Israel had been divided into two kingdoms, the north being called the kingdom of Israel and the south, the kingdom of Judah (<a href=1Ki.htm#v11_9>1&nbsp;Kings 11:9</a>&mdash;<a href=1Ki.htm#v12_24>12:24</a>). The northern kingdom of Israel became apostate and committed spiritual fornication (adultery) with idols (vv. <a href=Jer.htm#v3_6>6</a>, <a href=Jer.htm#v3_9>9</a>). Because of this, Jehovah divorced her (<a href=Jer.htm#v3_8>v. 8a</a>). Israel&rsquo;s treacherous sister, Judah, saw what Israel did and how she was punished for the evil thing she did. However, Judah did not fear but committed fornication also (vv. <a href=Jer.htm#v3_7>7b</a>, <a href=Jer.htm#v3_8>8b</a>)."

BD["a1;\x8c"]="For when every commandment according to the law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll <I>of</I> <I>the</I> <I>covenant</I> itself and all the people,"

BD["=01\x97"]="<b>wall</b><br> &emsp; If the younger one (see <a href=SoSN.htm#n8_8x1>note 8<sup>1</sup></a>) is a wall for separation from the world (sanctification), Christ&rsquo;s mature lover with her Beloved will perfect that one by building upon her a battlement based on the redemption of Christ (silver). If the younger one is a door as an entry for people to enter into Christ, the lover of Christ with her Beloved will perfect that one by building an enclosure around her with Christ&rsquo;s heavenly and glorified humanity (<a href=Mat.htm#v26_64>Matt. 26:64</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v3_13>Acts 3:13</a>) and His heavenly human life (cedar&mdash;<a href=Phi.htm#v2_7>Phil. 2:7</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v2_8>8</a>). This indicates that the lover of Christ is an experienced one who knows not only how to nourish others but also how to build them up with the proper materials according to their particular need."
BD["e)*\x9b"]="<b>Father</b><br> &emsp; The Father is the source of the eternal life; from Him and with Him the Son was manifested as the expression of the eternal life for the people of the Father&rsquo;s choice to partake of and enjoy."
BD["a17\x98"]="<b>promise</b><br> &emsp; The promise of the eternal inheritance is based on Christ&rsquo;s eternal redemption, not on our work, and is different from the promise in <a href=Heb.htm#v10_36>10:36</a>, which is conditioned on our endurance and our doing the will of God. (See <a href=HebN.htm#n10_36x2>note 36<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v10>ch. 10</a>.) The eternal inheritance in the promise here is through the eternal redemption of Christ, whereas the great reward (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_35>10:35</a>) in the promise in <a href=Heb.htm#v10_36>10:36</a> is given by virtue of our endurance and our doing the will of God."

BD["d+.\x98"]="<b>world</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means order, a system, referring here to the world with its inhabitants. The earth in the preceding verse became the world in this verse&mdash;not merely the earth, but the earth with its inhabitants in a system. This refers to the world in Noah&rsquo;s age, which was judged by God with the flood because of the sinfulness and ungodliness of that age (<a href=Gen.htm#v6_5>Gen. 6:5</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v6_7>7</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v6_11>11</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v6_13>13</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v6_17>17</a>). This book is concerned mainly with the divine government and all its judgments. The first judgment on the world was the one executed by the flood in Noah&rsquo;s day, which cleared up that ungodly world. This must have been Peter&rsquo;s thought while he was writing this verse, implying that this age of apostasy will also be judged on the day of the Lord&rsquo;s appearing, as in the day of Noah (<a href=Mat.htm#v24_37>Matt. 24:37</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v24_39>39</a>)."
