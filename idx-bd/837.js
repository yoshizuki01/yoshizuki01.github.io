BD["()B\x9b"]="<b>dominion</b><br> &emsp; God created a corporate man not only to express Himself with His image but also to represent Him by exercising His dominion over all things. God&rsquo;s intention in giving man dominion is (1) to subdue God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, who rebelled against God; (2) to recover the earth, which was usurped by Satan; and (3) to exercise God&rsquo;s authority over the earth in order that the kingdom of God may come to the earth, the will of God may be done on the earth, and the glory of God may be manifested on the earth (<a href=Mat.htm#v6_10>Matt. 6:10</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v6_13>13b</a>).<br> &emsp; God&rsquo;s intention that man would express God in His image and represent God with His dominion is fulfilled not in Adam as the first man (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45a</a>), the old man (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_6>Rom. 6:6</a>), but in Christ as the second man (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_47>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:47b</a> and <a href=1CoN.htm#n15_47x2>note 2</a>), the new man (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_15>Eph. 2:15</a> and <a href=EphN.htm#n2_15x8>note 8</a>), comprising Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_22>Eph. 1:22</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>23</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v12_12>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:12</a> and <a href=1CoN.htm#n12_12x2>note 2</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v3_10>Col. 3:10</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v3_11>11</a> and <a href=ColN.htm#n3_11x9>note 11<sup>9</sup></a>).

BD["(+=\x98"]="<b>clothed</b><br> &emsp; Genuine substitution is based on union. After being clothed by God with a coat of lamb skins, Adam became one with the lamb. Thus, the sinner became one with the substitute. This is union. Union brings in the effectiveness of substitution. When we believe in the gospel, Christ is put upon us as our covering righteousness (cf. <a href=Luk.htm#v15_22>Luke 15:22</a>), and we are put into Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>), making us one with Christ. Since we are one with Christ, whatever He has accomplished on the cross becomes ours. To believe in Jesus Christ is to be one with Him, to enter into a union with Him (see <a href=JohN.htm#n3_16x2>note 16<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Joh.htm#v3>John 3</a>). In such a union, whatever Christ is, whatever He has, whatever He has done and will do, and whatever He has attained and obtained are ours. See notes <a href=GenN.htm#n6_14x3P2>14<sup>3</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=Gen.htm#v6>ch. 6</a>; <a href=GenN.htm#n8_18x1P2>18<sup>1</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=Gen.htm#v8>ch. 8</a>; <a href=ExoN.htm#n12_22x2>22<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v12>Exo. 12</a>; and <a href=1JoN.htm#n2_2x2>2<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=1Jo.htm#v2>1&nbsp;John 2</a>.<br> &emsp; The main items of the gospel are seen in vv. <a href=Gen.htm#v3_15>15</a> and <a href=Gen.htm#v3_21>21</a>, which indicate that God, the Creator of man, became man&rsquo;s Savior after man&rsquo;s fall by becoming a human seed to die in order to destroy Satan, to redeem fallen man, and to become man&rsquo;s righteousness before God that he might be justified and be in God to be one with Him."
