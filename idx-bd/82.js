BD["i<.\x9a"]="<b>priests</b><br> &emsp; The overcomers will be priests, drawing near to God and Christ, and kings, reigning over the nations with Christ in the millennium (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_26>2:26</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v2_27>27</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v12_5>12:5</a>). As priests, they satisfy God and Christ, who enjoy their service, and as kings they reign for God and represent God, shepherding man for man&rsquo;s enjoyment and satisfaction. This is a reward to the overcomers. The believers who are defeated in this age will forfeit this reward. However, after being dealt with by the Lord in the millennium, these defeated ones will participate in the blessing of this reward, which will be to serve God and represent God in the kingship in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_3>22:3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>5</a>)."
