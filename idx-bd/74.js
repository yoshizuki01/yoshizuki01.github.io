BD["W+6\x99"]="<b>Spirit</b><br> &emsp; This verse indicates that the Spirit is the blessing that God promised to Abraham for all the nations and that has been received by the believers through faith in Christ. The Spirit is the compound Spirit, as mentioned in <a href=GalN.htm#n3_5x2>note 5<sup>2</sup></a>, and actually is God Himself processed in His Trinity through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension that we may receive Him as our life and our everything. This is the focus of the gospel of God.<br> &emsp; The physical aspect of the blessing that God promised to Abraham was the good land (<a href=Gen.htm#v12_7>Gen. 12:7</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v13_15>13:15</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v17_8>17:8</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v26_3>26:3</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v26_4>4</a>), which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ (see <a href=Col.htm#v1_12>Col. 1:12</a> and <a href=ColN.htm#n1_12x2>note 2</a>). Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:17</a>), the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds with the blessing of the land promised to Abraham. Actually, the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God&rsquo;s bountiful supply for us to enjoy."

This proves not only that the Son and the Father are one (<a href=Joh.htm#v10_30>10:30</a>) but also that the Holy Spirit is one with the Father and the Son. The Holy Spirit, who is sent by the Father in the Son&rsquo;s name, is not only the reality that comes from the Father but also the reality that comes from the Son.
