To confront the death, corruption, and confusion in the church&rsquo;s decline, the eternal life, on which <a href=2Ti.htm#v1>ch. 1</a> is based (<a href=2Ti.htm#v1_1>1:1</a>, <a href=2Ti.htm#v1_10>10</a>), the divine truth, emphasized in <a href=2Ti.htm#v2>ch. 2</a> (<a href=2Ti.htm#v2_15>2:15</a>, <a href=2Ti.htm#v2_18>18</a>, <a href=2Ti.htm#v2_25>25</a>), and the Holy Scripture, highly regarded in <a href=2Ti.htm#v3>ch. 3</a> (<a href=2Ti.htm#v3_14>3:14</a>-<a href=2Ti.htm#v3_17>17</a>), are all needed. The eternal life not only swallows up death but also renders the life supply; the divine truth replaces the vanity of corruption with the reality of all the divine riches; and the Holy Scripture not only dispels the confusion but also furnishes divine light and revelation. Hence, in this book the apostle stressed these three things."

BD["]-;\x97"]="<b>receive</b><br> &emsp; Timothy was charged by the apostle Paul to receive an accusation against an elder. This indicates that after they have appointed men as elders, the apostles still have the authority to deal with the elders."
BD["_+/\x97"]="<b>In</b><br> &emsp; This verse speaks forth the issue and goal of God&rsquo;s salvation (<a href=Tit.htm#v3_5>v. 5</a>) and justification (<a href=Tit.htm#v3_7>v. 7</a>), which include the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit (vv. <a href=Tit.htm#v3_5>5</a>-<a href=Tit.htm#v3_6>6</a>). This issue and goal are to make us heirs of God according to the hope of eternal life."
BD["^*;\x97"]="<b>foundation</b><br> &emsp; Verses <a href=2Ti.htm#v2_14>14</a>-<a href=2Ti.htm#v2_18>18</a> give instruction concerning how to deal with heresies, on the negative side, and handle the truth, on the positive side. According to the context of vv. <a href=2Ti.htm#v2_15>15</a>, <a href=2Ti.htm#v2_18>18</a>, and <a href=2Ti.htm#v2_25>25</a>, the foundation here does not refer to Christ as the foundation of the church (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_11>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:11</a>) but to the church as the foundation of the truth. This corresponds with the base of the truth, which holds the truth (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>), especially the truth of the resurrection of Christ (<a href=Act.htm#v4_33>Acts 4:33</a>).<br> &emsp; The church is built with the divine life in Christ, a life that is indestructible, unconquerable (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_16>Heb. 7:16</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v2_24>Acts 2:24</a>), and able to withstand deathly decline originating from any source. Hence, the church is the firm foundation of God that stands forever against any heresy."
