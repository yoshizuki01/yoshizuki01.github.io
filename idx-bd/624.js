This land, which was invaded by the army of Assyria, is the land that Christ will inherit to build up His millennial kingdom with His two elect peoples, the chosen Jews as His earthly people and the chosen believers as His heavenly people. God&rsquo;s eternal economy is to gain for Himself these two peoples as a treasure.<br> &emsp; Satan, God&rsquo;s enemy, uses the nations to frustrate the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s economy. The invaders and occupiers of the Holy Land, the land of Immanuel, are signified by the human image in <a href=Dan.htm#v2>Dan. 2</a>, the head of which is Babylon. The enemies of God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament began from Babylon (<a href=2Ki.htm#v24>2&nbsp;Kings 24</a>&mdash;<a href=2Ki.htm#v25>25</a>), which issued from Babel (<a href=Gen.htm#v11_1>Gen. 11:1</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v11_9>9</a>). In the New Testament the enemy of God&rsquo;s chosen people, the church, still is called Babylon&mdash;Babylon the Great (<a href=Rev.htm#v17>Rev. 17</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v18>18</a>). Eventually, both the religious Babylon (the apostate Roman Church) and the material Babylon (the city of Rome) will be destroyed, after which the kingdom will come. Even the termination of Babylon is included in the sign of a virgin bearing a son called Immanuel. The sign of Immanuel is still being fulfilled today. It is an all-inclusive sign that covers the Bible from <a href=Gen.htm#v11>Gen. 11</a> through <a href=Rev.htm#v22>Rev. 22</a>. See <a href=IsaN.htm#n7_14x1>note 14<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Isa.htm#v7>ch. 7</a>."

The second and third Epistles of John stress this truth. The second warns the faithful believers against receiving those who do not abide in this truth&mdash;in the teaching concerning Christ. The third encourages the believers to receive and help those who work for this truth."

Ezekiel also was taken captive at that time. From this verse to the end of the book the years are counted from the year of captivity. Five years after he was captured, Ezekiel began to see the visions in this chapter. In the following years he continued to see visions concerning a later capture of Jerusalem, which took place in the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah, who replaced Jehoiachin as king of Judah (<a href=2Ki.htm#v24_17>2&nbsp;Kings 24:17</a>&mdash;<a href=2Ki.htm#v25_21>25:21</a>). While Ezekiel was in captivity he was brought back in the Spirit to Jerusalem to see the coming events.

It was mainly through Ezekiel&rsquo;s prophesying to the people in captivity (<a href=Ezk.htm#v3_10>3:10</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v3_11>11</a>) that they eventually detested the idols, turned their hearts to God, and were returned to their homeland after seventy years.<br> &emsp; The Bible as a whole, and the book of Ezekiel as a miniature of the Bible, reveal that God&rsquo;s eternal intention is to dispense Himself into His chosen people, making them the same as He is in His life, His nature, and His image but not in His Godhead, that they might be mingled with Him as one entity and be built together in Him to be His eternal habitation, the New Jerusalem.

This one sacrifice, viewed from its various aspects, can be considered many sacrifices. As Christ is the eternal Son of the living God incarnated to be the Son of Man, and as He offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit, so His sacrifices, which are Himself, are better than the animal sacrifices. Those were shadows that could never remove sins (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_11>10:11</a>), but His sacrifices are real and have put away sin once for all (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_26>v. 26</a>).
