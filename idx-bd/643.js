This kind of faith is precious to God and is accounted by Him as righteousness. Abraham was justified by such a faith (<a href=Rom.htm#v4_1>Rom. 4:1</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v4_5>5</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n4_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a>)."

In order for God to regain the earth from the usurping hand of Satan, God&rsquo;s people needed to be in full cooperation and coordination with God as in the principle of incarnation (see <a href=1CoN.htm#n7_40x2>note 40<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=1Co.htm#v7>1&nbsp;Cor. 7</a>).

BD["O2+\x98"]="<b>tax</b><br> &emsp; Here Matthew specifically designated himself &ldquo;the tax collector,&rdquo; perhaps remembering his salvation with gratitude. Even a despised and sinful tax collector could become an apostle of the King of the heavenly kingdom. What a salvation!"

His teaching released the word of light to enlighten those in the darkness of death that they might receive the light of life (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_4>John 1:4</a>). The second thing that the Slave of God did in His service as the Slave-Savior to fallen men was to carry out such teaching (<a href=Mrk.htm#v2_13>2:13</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v4_1>4:1</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v6_2>6:2</a>, <a href=Mrk.htm#v6_6>6</a>, <a href=Mrk.htm#v6_30>30</a>, <a href=Mrk.htm#v6_34>34</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v10_1>10:1</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v11_17>11:17</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v12_35>12:35</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v14_49>14:49</a>) to bring people out of the satanic darkness into the divine light (<a href=Act.htm#v26_18>Acts 26:18</a>)."

According to His New Testament economy, God will not move, act, or do anything by Himself. He needs man&rsquo;s cooperation and coordination. In Numbers the omnipotent God moved in a portable home in wagons drawn by oxen. Similarly, today God needs His people to offer themselves to Him as the means for His move."
