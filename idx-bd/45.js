BD["M11\x97"]="<b>Exult</b><br> &emsp; The prophecy in vv. <a href=Zec.htm#v9_9>9</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v9_10>10</a> is an insertion; <a href=Zec.htm#v9_11>v. 11</a> is the continuation of <a href=Zec.htm#v9_8>v. 8</a>. The prophecy in <a href=Zec.htm#v9_9>v. 9</a> reveals that Christ would come in a righteous way with salvation for God&rsquo;s people and that He would come as a King, but as a lowly King, a humiliated King, riding not on a majestic horse but on a donkey, even a colt of a donkey. This was fulfilled when Jesus Christ came into Jerusalem the last time (<a href=Mat.htm#v21_1>Matt. 21:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v21_11>11</a>). At that time Christ was temporarily welcomed by the people of Israel.<br> &emsp; The prophecy concerning the coming of Christ in this verse and the prophecy concerning the millennial kingdom in <a href=Zec.htm#v9_10>v. 10</a> are inserted between the first part of the chapter, concerned with Alexander the Great, and the last part, concerned with Antiochus Epiphanes. This entire book indicates that the all-inclusive Christ, who is the center and the circumference, the centrality and the universality, of God&rsquo;s move to fulfill His economy on the earth, is intimately involved with human history and with the great human empires, especially the empires of Persia (chs. <a href=Zec.htm#v1>1</a>&mdash;<a href=Zec.htm#v6>6</a>), and Greece and Rome (chs. <a href=Zec.htm#v7>7</a>&mdash;<a href=Zec.htm#v14>14</a>)."

The horns on the altar, which are toward the four corners of the earth, signify the power of the cross of Christ to reach the four corners of the earth.

BD["O-+\x97"]="<b>Blessed</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word implies happy. It may also be rendered blessed and happy. So in succeeding verses. The word spoken by the new King, being the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, is a revelation of the spiritual living and heavenly principles of the kingdom of the heavens. It is composed of seven sections. The first section, vv. <a href=Mat.htm#v5_3>3</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v5_12>12</a>, depicts the nature of the people of the kingdom of the heavens, who are under nine blessings. They are people who are poor in spirit, who mourn for the present situation, who are meek in suffering opposition, who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness, who are merciful toward others, who are pure in heart, who make peace, who suffer persecution for righteousness, and who are reproached and evilly spoken of because of the Lord."
BD[">]4\x97"]="<b>Great</b><br> &emsp; The first part of this verse concerns Christ in His ascension. The Great and the Strong here refer to God. In Christ&rsquo;s ascension God divided to Christ a portion with God as the great One, and Christ divided the spoil with God as the strong One."
BD[">]3\x9a"]="<b>make</b><br> &emsp; Christ will make righteous those who know Him as the righteous One. Since this verse refers to Christ in His resurrection, to make us righteous is not merely to justify us objectively but to make us righteous subjectively by His living in us as the resurrection life and our living Him (<a href=Mat.htm#v5_20>Matt. 5:20</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n5_20x1>note 1</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v5_19>Rom. 5:19</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n5_19x1>note 1</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v5_21>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:21</a> and <a href=2CoN.htm#n5_21x3>note 3</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v3_9>Phil. 3:9</a> and <a href=PhiN.htm#n3_9x5>note 5</a>)."
BD[">\\7\x97"]="<b>surprise</b><br> &emsp; Jesus will surprise many nations, and kings will shut their mouths because of Him, for what He is, is altogether different from what they imagined. People are surprised to learn that a great person such as Christ was actually a small man who lived in the despised region of Galilee, in the despised city of Nazareth, in the poor home of a carpenter, and that He was rejected and put on the cross and crucified (<a href=Isa.htm#v53_2>53:2</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v53_10>10a</a>)."
BD["O,.\x97"]="<b>cast</b><br> &emsp; There was no need for the Lord Jesus to do this. It was simply a temptation enticing Him to show that as the Son of God He was able to act miraculously. Any thought of doing miraculous things in religion is a temptation of the devil."
BD["+**\x99"]="<b>facing</b><br> &emsp; Or, a distance from. That the children of Israel were encamped facing the Tent of Meeting indicates that the testimony of God&mdash;the Ark within the tabernacle, which contained the law as God&rsquo;s testimony (<a href=Exo.htm#v25_16>Exo. 25:16</a>)&mdash;was their unique center and goal (see notes <a href=ExoN.htm#n20_1x1>1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v20>Exo. 20</a> and <a href=ExoN.htm#n25_10x1>10<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v25>Exo. 25</a>). This signifies that Christ, the embodiment of God, is the center and goal of God&rsquo;s people, who are journeying and fighting for God&rsquo;s testimony.<br> &emsp; The children of Israel encamping around the Tent of Meeting indicates that they were formed into an army to fight for the protection of God&rsquo;s testimony (the Ark in the tabernacle, typifying Christ and His Body, the church, as the incarnated and embodied God). In the same way, the church today is fighting for the protection of the incarnated God. God in Himself needs no protection, but God in His embodiment needs to be protected by the fighting of the church as a formed, coordinated Body (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n16_18x6>note 6</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a> and <a href=JohN.htm#n1_14x2>note 2</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v6_10>Eph. 6:10</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v6_20>20</a> and <a href=EphN.htm#n6_11x2P2>note 11<sup>2</sup>, par. 2</a>)."

God has cut off the Jews and has raised up the believing Gentiles to be descendants of Abraham in faith (<a href=Rom.htm#v11_15>Rom. 11:15a</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v11_19>19</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v11_20>20</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v11_22>22</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v3_7>Gal. 3:7</a>, <a href=Gal.htm#v3_28>28</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v3_29>29</a>). John&rsquo;s word in this verse clearly indicates that the kingdom of the heavens preached by him is constituted not of the children of Abraham by birth but of the children of Abraham by faith; thus, it is a heavenly kingdom, not the earthly kingdom of the Messiah."
