It refers to words, speeches, and conversations concerning such things as rumors, reports, true or false stories, and fictions. It might include Jewish stories of miracles, rabbinical fabrications, etc. These were profane and old-womanish myths (<a href=1Ti.htm#v4_7>4:7</a>) and Jewish myths (<a href=Tit.htm#v1_14>Titus 1:14</a>)."
BD["SB;\x97"]="<b>vision</b><br> &emsp; Not a doctrine, a theory, a religious creed, or any theology, but a heavenly vision, in which the apostle saw the divine things concerning the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people. All his preaching in this book and his writing in his fourteen Epistles, from Romans through Hebrews, are a detailed description of this heavenly vision seen by Paul."

BD["U7J\x97"]="<b>Awake</b><br> &emsp; Or, Cease, righteously, to be drunken. Righteously means being right with God and with man. To say that there is no resurrection offends God and man. This is to commit sin and thereby be unrighteous. Hence, the apostle advised the misled Corinthians to awake soberly from this sin and restore a right relationship with God and man. They were drunken unrighteously in the stupor of the no-resurrection heresy. They needed to cease being in that stupor."
BD["\\+/\x97"]="<b>not</b><br> &emsp; The apostles were for the building up of the church in all things (<a href=2Co.htm#v12_19>2&nbsp;Cor. 12:19</a>); they were absolutely not disorderly among the believers but were a pattern for the believers to imitate (<a href=2Th.htm#v3_9>v. 9</a>)."
BD["S\@A\x97"]="<b>reasoning</b><br> &emsp; Lit., saying thoroughly, discussing (in argument or exhortation), disputing. The same as in <a href=Act.htm#v17_2>17:2</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v18_4>18:4</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v18_19>19</a>."
BD["U6M\x97"]="<b>prophet</b><br> &emsp; This too indicates that to be a prophet or to be a spiritual person is highly esteemed in the church for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. A prophet is second to an apostle in God&rsquo;s administration in the church (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_28>12:28</a>). He is one who speaks for God and speaks forth God, and who has received revelation of the mysteries concerning Christ and the church (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_5>Eph. 3:5</a>), which revelation is the foundation for the building of the church (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_20>Eph. 2:20</a>). A spiritual person is one who lives according to his spirit, which is mingled with God&rsquo;s Spirit, and who is able to discern all the spiritual things (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_1>3:1</a> and <a href=1CoN.htm#n3_1x1>notes</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v2_15>2:15</a> and <a href=1CoN.htm#n2_15x1>note</a>). Such spiritually knowledgeable persons should fully know that the apostle Paul&rsquo;s teachings are the commandment of the Lord, and their speaking should correspond with his teachings. Paul&rsquo;s spirit was strong and his word was frank in dealing with the disorderly Corinthians. He charged them to know definitely that his teachings were a commandment of the Lord, having the authentic authority of the Lord."

BD[":\x8e8\x97"]="<b>built</b><br> &emsp; Here the rebuilding of Zion typifies the rebuilding of the church. The history of Israel is a portrait of the history of the church (<a href=1Co.htm#v9_24>1&nbsp;Cor. 9:24</a>&mdash;<a href=1Co.htm#v10_11>10:11</a>). After existing on the earth for a time, Israel passed through a period of destruction and devastation, and the people of Israel were carried away to captivity in Babylon (<a href=2Ki.htm#v24>2&nbsp;Kings 24</a>&mdash;<a href=2Ki.htm#v25>25</a>). Likewise, the church was produced through Christ&rsquo;s death and in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, and then it existed on earth for a time before it became degraded (see notes <a href=2TiN.htm#n1_1x1>1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=2Ti.htm#v1>2&nbsp;Tim. 1</a>, <a href=2PeN.htm#n1_3x1>3<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=2Pe.htm#v1>2&nbsp;Pet. 1</a>, and <a href=RevN.htm#n2_4x2>4<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v2>Rev. 2</a>) and was eventually devastated. The book of Revelation shows that Babylon the Great is versus the church (<a href=Rev.htm#v17_1>Rev. 17:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v17_6>6</a>). Eventually, Babylon the Great will fall (<a href=Rev.htm#v17_16>Rev. 17:16</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v18_2>18:2</a>) and the church will be fully established (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>Rev. 21:2</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>22:5</a>)."
