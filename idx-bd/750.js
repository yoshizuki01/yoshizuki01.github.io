BD["S2W\x97"]="<b>as</b><br> &emsp; Like the early apostles and the Jewish believers on the day of Pentecost (<a href=Act.htm#v2_4>2:4</a>), the Gentile believers in the house of Cornelius received the Holy Spirit economically directly from the ascended Head. Only these two instances in the New Testament are considered the baptism in the Holy Spirit (<a href=Act.htm#v1_5>1:5</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v11_15>11:15</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v11_16>16</a>). By these two steps the Head of the Body baptized all His believers, both Jewish and Gentile, once for all into His one Body (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_13>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:13</a>). Hence, the baptism in the Spirit is an accomplished fact carried out by Christ in His ascension, on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius. None of the other cases&mdash;the Samaritan believers in <a href=Act.htm#v8>ch. 8</a>, Saul of Tarsus in <a href=Act.htm#v9>ch. 9</a>, and the twelve Ephesian believers in <a href=Act.htm#v19>ch. 19</a>&mdash;are considered the baptism in the Holy Spirit according to the revelation of the New Testament. These other cases were merely the believers&rsquo; experiences of the once-for-all-accomplished baptism in the Holy Spirit.<br> &emsp; In this book, concerning the believers&rsquo; receiving of the Holy Spirit economically, that is, the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s falling upon them, only five cases are mentioned. Two of them are for the accomplishing of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. These are the instances that occurred on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius. The other three&mdash;the cases of the Samaritan believers, Saul of Tarsus, and the twelve believers in Ephesus&mdash;are considered extraordinary, in that some members of the Body of Christ were needed to identify those believers with the Body by the laying on of hands. Besides these five cases, in many cases of conversion, such as the three thousand (<a href=Act.htm#v2_41>2:41</a>), the five thousand (<a href=Act.htm#v4_4>4:4</a>), the Ethiopian eunuch (<a href=Act.htm#v8_36>8:36</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v8_38>38</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v8_39>39a</a>), the many who believed in Antioch (<a href=Act.htm#v11_20>11:20</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v11_21>21</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v11_24>24</a>), the many instances in chs. <a href=Act.htm#v13>13</a> and <a href=Act.htm#v14>14</a> under Paul&rsquo;s preaching ministry, Lydia in Philippi (<a href=Act.htm#v16_14>16:14</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v16_15>15</a>), the jailer in Philippi (<a href=Act.htm#v16_33>16:33</a>), the believers in Thessalonica (<a href=Act.htm#v17_4>17:4</a>), the believers in Berea (<a href=Act.htm#v17_10>17:10</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v17_12>12</a>), the believers in Athens (<a href=Act.htm#v17_34>17:34</a>), the ruler of the synagogue and many other believers in Corinth (<a href=Act.htm#v18_8>18:8</a>), and the believers in Ephesus (<a href=Act.htm#v19_18>19:18</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v19_19>19</a>), there is no mention of the believers&rsquo; receiving of the Holy Spirit economically&mdash;the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s falling upon the believers&mdash;because in all these cases the believers were brought into the Body of Christ in a normal way through their believing and had no particular need for a member of the Body of Christ to bring them into identification with the Body by the laying on of hands. According to the principle of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, they all must have received the Holy Spirit essentially for life and economically for power in a normal way through their believing into Christ."

It was of God&rsquo;s sovereignty that not long before that time the Roman Empire had made it a law that criminals sentenced to death should be crucified.

BD["Y);\x9a"]="<b>Spirit</b><br> &emsp; The revelation in the Bible concerning God, Christ, and the Spirit is progressive. The Spirit is mentioned first as the Spirit of God, in relation to creation (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_2>Gen. 1:2</a>). Then, He is mentioned as the Spirit of Jehovah, in the context of God&rsquo;s relationship with man (<a href=Jdg.htm#v3_10>Judg. 3:10</a>; <a href=1Sa.htm#v10_6>1&nbsp;Sam. 10:6</a>); as the Holy Spirit, in relation to the conception and birth of Christ (<a href=Luk.htm#v1_35>Luke 1:35</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v1_20>Matt. 1:20</a>); as the Spirit of Jesus, in relation to the Lord&rsquo;s human living (<a href=Act.htm#v16_7>Acts 16:7</a>); as the Spirit of Christ, in relation to the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_9>Rom. 8:9</a>); and here as the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<br> &emsp; The Spirit of Jesus Christ is &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; mentioned in <a href=Joh.htm#v7_39>John 7:39</a>. This is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, compounded with the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation (humanity), human living under the cross, crucifixion, and resurrection. The holy anointing ointment in <a href=Exo.htm#v30_23>Exo. 30:23</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v30_25>25</a>, a compound of olive oil and four kinds of spices, is a full type of this compound Spirit of God, who is now the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Here it is not the Spirit of Jesus (<a href=Act.htm#v16_7>Acts 16:7</a>) or the Spirit of Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_9>Rom. 8:9</a>) but the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus is related mainly to the Lord&rsquo;s humanity and human living; the Spirit of Christ is related mainly to the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. To experience the Lord&rsquo;s humanity, as illustrated in <a href=Phi.htm#v2_5>2:5</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v2_8>8</a>, we need the Spirit of Jesus. To experience the power of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, as mentioned in <a href=Phi.htm#v3_10>3:10</a>, we need the Spirit of Christ. In his suffering the apostle experienced both the Lord&rsquo;s suffering in His humanity and the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. Hence, the Spirit to him was the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God. Such a Spirit has, and even is, the bountiful supply for a person like the apostle, who was experiencing and enjoying Christ in His human living and resurrection. Eventually, this compound Spirit of Jesus Christ becomes the seven Spirits of God, who are the seven lamps of fire before God&rsquo;s throne to carry out His administration on earth for the accomplishing of His economy concerning the church, and who are the seven eyes of the Lamb for the transfusing of all that He is into the church (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_4>Rev. 1:4</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v4_5>4:5</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v5_6>5:6</a>)."
