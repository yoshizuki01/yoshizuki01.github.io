To be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus is to be baptized into the person of the Lord, to be identified with the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, to be put into an organic union with the living Lord. See notes <a href=ActN.htm#n2_38x3>38<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Act.htm#v2>ch. 2</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n28_19x4>19<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v28>Matt. 28</a>.<br> &emsp; In <a href=Mat.htm#v28_19>Matt. 28:19</a> the Lord charged the disciples to baptize the believers into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. But later, in practice, the believers were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus, here and in <a href=Act.htm#v19_5>19:5</a>, and into Christ, in <a href=Rom.htm#v6_3>Rom. 6:3</a> and <a href=Gal.htm#v3_27>Gal. 3:27</a>. This indicates that (1) to be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus is equivalent to being baptized into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, because the Lord Jesus is the Triune God, the embodiment of God Himself (<a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>), and (2) to be baptized into the name of the Triune God or into the name of the Lord Jesus is equivalent to being baptized into the person of Christ."

BD["2))\x97"]="<b>Now</b><br> &emsp; The striking point of the historical books concerning Israel is that they portray in detail, in the way of typology, how to experience Christ as the good land given to us by God as our portion (see <a href=DeuN.htm#n8_7x1>note 7<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Deu.htm#v8>Deut. 8</a>). First, the book of Joshua shows the way to gain, to take possession of, and to keep the good land. Then the books of Judges, Ruth, and 1 and 2&nbsp;Samuel show how certain persons remained in the good land and enjoyed the good land after they took possession of it. First and 2&nbsp;Kings are needed to show how more persons remained in and enjoyed the good land.<br> &emsp; The kings, as representatives of Israel, enjoyed the good land on the highest level. They are types of the New Testament believers, who were saved by God to enjoy Christ as their good land up to the level of the kingship (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_17>Rom. 5:17</a>; <a href=2Ti.htm#v2_12>2&nbsp;Tim. 2:12</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>Rev. 20:4</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>22:5b</a>). The picture portrayed in the two books of Kings depicts in detail the character, intention, preferences, habits, morality, and actions of all the kings who reigned over Israel after David the king. Such a picture indicates that what we are, what we desire, what we intend to do, and how we behave have very much to do with our remaining in Christ and participating in all His unsearchable riches for our enjoyment. This picture concerning Israel ends with a tragedy of all the kings who were put into the blessed situation of the kingship and who were not faithful to God and did not take good care of their inheritance: they lost the good land and were carried away as captives to the idol-worshipping world. This should be a solemn alarm and warning to us in our relationship with Christ. If we are wrong in any of the matters mentioned above, we will suffer the loss of Christ as our enjoyment. See <a href=LevN.htm#n18_25x2>note 25<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Lev.htm#v18>Lev. 18</a>.<br> &emsp; The central thought of the books of Kings is God&rsquo;s governmental dealing, in God&rsquo;s economy, with the devastating and ruining of the divine kingship on the earth by the kings, and the tragic issue of the just dealing of God, i.e., the loss of the Holy Land, which was the base of God&rsquo;s kingdom on the earth, and the capture of the holy people, who maintained the line of Christ&rsquo;s genealogy. The devastating of the land and the carrying away of the holy people almost ended the two lines needed for the bringing of Christ into humanity (see <a href=MatN.htm#n1_16x2>note 16<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v1>Matt. 1</a>). Nevertheless, according to the genealogy in <a href=Mat.htm#v1_1>Matt. 1:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v1_17>17</a>, these two lines were continued even through the captivity. In His sovereignty God carried out the return from captivity in order to recover the good land and preserve fourteen generations of Christ&rsquo;s genealogy (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_17>Matt. 1:17c</a>). Thus God still carried out His intention to bring Himself in His Trinity into humanity and to set up His spiritual kingdom."

BD["(\@>\x97"]="<b>nose</b><br> &emsp; These gifts, sent from Isaac and given by the servant of Abraham, the father, signify the riches of Christ given by the Spirit of God to the bride for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s purpose. These gifts relate to the function of the believers. Gold signifies the divine nature, and a ring signifies the initial gift of the Spirit (<a href=Act.htm#v2_38>Acts 2:38</a>), which is the Spirit Himself as a seal and a pledge, a foretaste of God as our eternal portion (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_13>Eph. 1:13</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_14>14</a>; cf. <a href=Luk.htm#v15_22>Luke 15:22</a>). The function of the nose is to smell. The putting of the nose-ring upon Rebekah&rsquo;s nose (<a href=Gen.htm#v24_47>v. 47</a>) signifies, spiritually, that her &ldquo;smelling&rdquo; function had been caught by the divine nature (cf. <a href=2Co.htm#v2_14>2&nbsp;Cor. 2:14</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v2_16>16</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v6_4>Heb. 6:4</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v6_6>6</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_2>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:2</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_3>3</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v1_4>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:4</a>).

In this Passover, Christ is not only the Passover lamb but also the entire Passover. To be our Passover, He was sacrificed on the cross that we might be redeemed and reconciled to God.

Breeding cattle without mixture signifies that life is not allowed to be mixed: those living by the life of God must not live by the flesh (cf. <a href=Gal.htm#v5_16>Gal. 5:16</a>). Sowing seed without mixture signifies that the ministry of the word is not allowed to be mixed: the word of God that is ministered should not be mixed with the word of the world (cf. <a href=1Co.htm#v2_13>1&nbsp;Cor. 2:13</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;Tim. 1:3</a>-<a href=1Ti.htm#v1_4>4</a>).

As the embodiment of God&rsquo;s testimony, the Ark typifies Christ as the embodiment of God (<a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>). The Ark as a type of Christ indicates that God&rsquo;s redeemed people can contact God and enjoy God in Christ and through Christ (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n25_22x1>note 22<sup>1</sup></a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v14_6>John 14:6</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_19>Heb. 10:19</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_20>20</a>).<br> &emsp; As the center and content of the tabernacle, the Ark also signifies Christ as the center and content of the church as God&rsquo;s tabernacle, God&rsquo;s house (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_21>Eph. 2:21</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>22</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>). The fact that the Ark is the item first mentioned in the vision of the tabernacle and its furniture indicates that it occupies the place of preeminence (cf. <a href=Col.htm#v1_18>Col. 1:18</a>). It also indicates that the church, the Body of Christ, typified by the tabernacle, comes out of Christ, typified by the Ark. See <a href=ExoN.htm#n26_15x2>note 15<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v26>ch. 26</a> and <a href=GenN.htm#n2_22x1>note 22<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v2>Gen. 2</a>.

These three locations, corresponding to the three parts of the tabernacle&mdash;the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies&mdash;illustrate the fact that among God&rsquo;s people there are different degrees of fellowship with Him.

In the Old Testament type the firstfruits signify the resurrected Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_20>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:20</a>, <a href=1Co.htm#v15_23>23</a> and <a href=1CoN.htm#n15_20x2>note 20<sup>2</sup></a>) offered to God on the day of His resurrection (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_17>John 20:17</a>), typified in <a href=Lev.htm#v23_10>Lev. 23:10</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v23_11>11</a> by the firstfruits offered to God on the day after the Sabbath, the day of resurrection (<a href=Mat.htm#v28_1>Matt. 28:1</a>). The day of Pentecost was exactly fifty days from the day of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. On the day of Pentecost, the Spirit as the full issue of the resurrected Christ was poured out on the church (<a href=Act.htm#v2_1>Acts 2:1</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v2_4>4</a>). This indicates that the resurrected Christ became the Spirit poured out on His believers for their full enjoyment (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:17</a>).

BD[".08\x97"]="<b>trampled</b><br> &emsp; Following <a href=Jdg.htm#v8_7>v. 7</a>. The Hebrew may read, taught. After his great success, Gideon had a terrible failure. Intrinsically, Gideon&rsquo;s failure was due to his forsaking God and his joining himself to Satan (see <a href=JdgN.htm#n2_12x1>note 12<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Jdg.htm#v2>ch. 2</a>). The secret of his failure comprises three factors. First, Gideon was not kind; he killed those countrymen who did not support him (vv. <a href=Jdg.htm#v8_16>16</a>-<a href=Jdg.htm#v8_17>17</a>), breaking the sixth commandment of God (<a href=Exo.htm#v20_13>Exo. 20:13</a>). Second, he indulged in the lust of the flesh, not exercising any restriction over his fleshly lust (vv. <a href=Jdg.htm#v8_30>30</a>-<a href=Jdg.htm#v8_31>31</a>), thus breaking the seventh commandment (<a href=Exo.htm#v20_14>Exo. 20:14</a>). Third, although he acted properly in refusing to rule over the people (vv. <a href=Jdg.htm#v8_22>22</a>-<a href=Jdg.htm#v8_23>23</a>), he coveted the spoil of his people (<a href=Jdg.htm#v8_24>v. 24</a>), thereby breaking the tenth commandment (<a href=Exo.htm#v20_17>Exo. 20:17</a>). Gideon&rsquo;s indulgence in sex and his greediness for gold led to idolatry (cf. <a href=Eph.htm#v5_5>Eph. 5:5</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v3_5>Col. 3:5</a>). Gideon made an ephod with the gold he had taken from the people, and this ephod became an idol to the children of Israel (<a href=Jdg.htm#v8_27>v. 27</a>). As a result, Gideon&rsquo;s family and the entire society of Israel were corrupted.<br> &emsp; In this book, which is related to the enjoyment of the good land as a type of Christ (see <a href=DeuN.htm#n8_7x1>note 7<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Deu.htm#v8>Deut. 8</a>), Gideon&rsquo;s success indicates the gaining of an excellent opportunity to enjoy Christ, whereas his failure indicates the losing of the opportunity to enjoy Christ. Gideon&rsquo;s failure shows that we must exercise strict control in dealing with the matters of sex and wealth. Any indulgence in these things will cause our enjoyment of Christ to be annulled. See notes <a href=2SaN.htm#n11_4x1>4<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=2Sa.htm#v11>2&nbsp;Sam. 11</a>, <a href=1KiN.htm#n11_43x1P3>43<sup>1</sup>, par. 3</a>, in <a href=1Ki.htm#v11>1&nbsp;Kings 11</a>, and <a href=GenN.htm#n14_23x1>23<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v14>Gen. 14</a>."
