Only one of these five was a chaste virgin&mdash;Mary, a descendant of the chosen race. Of her, Christ was directly born (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_16>v. 16</a>). Among the rest&mdash;Tamar, Rahab, Ruth (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_5>v. 5</a>), and Bathsheba, who had been the wife of Uriah (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_6>v. 6</a>)&mdash;some were Gentiles, some were remarried, and three were even sinful&mdash;Tamar committed incest, Rahab was a prostitute, and Bathsheba committed adultery. This indicates that Christ is related not only to the Jews but also to the Gentiles, even to the sinful people, and is the kingly Savior of typical sinners. Tamar was Judah&rsquo;s daughter-in-law. Judah begot Pharez and Zarah of her by incest (<a href=Gen.htm#v38_6>Gen. 38:6</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v38_30>30</a>). What an evil!"

Thus, the enmity between the serpent and the woman is the enmity between Satan and all God&rsquo;s people (see <a href=RevN.htm#n12_4x2>note 4<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v12>Rev. 12</a>). The serpent&rsquo;s hating and fighting against God&rsquo;s people began when Satan instigated Cain to murder Abel (<a href=Gen.htm#v4_8>4:8</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_12>1&nbsp;John 3:12</a>) and continues through all the generations until Satan is cast into the lake of fire for eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_7>Rev. 20:7</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_10>10</a>)."

BD["),+\x97"]="<b>serpent</b><br> &emsp; In <a href=Exo.htm#v3>chapter 3</a> God gave Moses the sign of the thornbush (<a href=Exo.htm#v3_2>3:2</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v3_3>3</a>). In this chapter God gave Moses three additional signs as evidence that he had truly been called and sent by God. The meaning of the first sign, the sign of the staff becoming a serpent (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v4_2>2</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v4_4>4</a>), is that anything we rely on apart from God&mdash;our education, our occupation, etc.&mdash;is actually the hiding place of Satan, the usurping serpent. However, when at God&rsquo;s word we throw it down and then take it up again &ldquo;by the tail,&rdquo; i.e., in the way opposite to the practice of the worldly people, using it for God&rsquo;s purpose and not for ourselves, it becomes a staff of authority (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v4_4>4</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v4_17>17</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v10_19>Luke 10:19</a>). In the second sign, the sign of the hand becoming leprous (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v4_6>6</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v4_7>7</a>), the bosom signifies what is within us, and leprosy signifies sin. This sign shows that our flesh is the embodiment of leprosy; in it there is nothing good, nothing but sin, corruption, and uncleanness (<a href=Rom.htm#v7_17>Rom. 7:17</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v7_18>18</a>; cf. <a href=Isa.htm#v6_5>Isa. 6:5</a>). Nevertheless, when we obey the Lord by keeping His word, His cleansing power is able to make us clean (cf. <a href=2Ki.htm#v5_1>2&nbsp;Kings 5:1</a>-<a href=2Ki.htm#v5_14>14</a>). The meaning of the third sign, the sign of the water becoming blood (<a href=Exo.htm#v4_9>v. 9</a>), is that in the eyes of God all the earthly supply and worldly enjoyment (the water of the Nile) are nothing but death (blood). When they are poured out on that which produces life (the ground), immediately the death is exposed.<br> &emsp; Satan is against Christ (<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_8>1&nbsp;John 3:8</a>); the flesh is against the Spirit (<a href=Gal.htm#v5_17>Gal. 5:17</a>); and the world is against the Father (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_15>1&nbsp;John 2:15</a>). Hence, these three negative things are opposed to the Triune God and His economy. In one whom God has called, Satan, the flesh, and the world have lost their ground (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v14_30>John 14:30</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v5_24>Gal. 5:24</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v6_14>6:14</a>)."

By such a revelation Moses came to know the One who was calling and sending him to carry out His commission. The divine title in this verse indicates that God is the covenanting God (<a href=Exo.htm#v2_24>2:24</a>) and also implies that He is the God of resurrection (<a href=Mat.htm#v22_31>Matt. 22:31</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v22_32>32</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n22_32x1>note</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v3_13>Acts 3:13</a>). Furthermore, that God is the God of three persons (cf. <a href=Exo.htm#v3_15>v. 15</a>) implies that He is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (<a href=Mat.htm#v28_19>Matt. 28:19</a>).
