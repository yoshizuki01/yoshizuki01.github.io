BD[">R.\x97"]="<b>covenant</b><br> &emsp; Christ has been called by Jehovah to be a covenant for the people, i.e., for Israel (<a href=Isa.htm#v42_6>v. 6b</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v49_8>49:8b</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v7_22>Heb. 7:22</a>). The covenant is the legal agreement between God and His people (cf. <a href=Jer.htm#v31_31>Jer. 31:31</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v31_34>34</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v8_8>Heb. 8:8</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v8_12>12</a>). Through the death of Christ, the covenant became a testament, a will (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_16>Heb. 9:16</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v9_17>17</a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n9_16x1>note 16<sup>1</sup></a>). Christ enacted the new covenant (which became the new testament&mdash;the will) with His blood according to God&rsquo;s righteousness through His redeeming death (<a href=Mat.htm#v26_28>Matt. 26:28</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v22_20>Luke 22:20</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v9_15>Heb. 9:15</a>).

Therefore, Christ is the new covenant as the new testament.<br> &emsp; Christ, as the embodiment of the riches of the Godhead (<a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v1_19>1:19</a>) and as the crucified and resurrected One, has become the covenant of God given to His people. He is the reality of all that God is and of all that God has given us. God&rsquo;s salvation, God&rsquo;s righteousness, God&rsquo;s justification, God&rsquo;s forgiveness, God&rsquo;s redemption, God&rsquo;s riches, and all God has and will do have been covenanted to us. As the reality of all the bequests in the new testament, Christ, who is the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, consummated Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:17</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_9>Rom. 8:9</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_11>11</a>), is in our spirit and has become one spirit with us (<a href=2Ti.htm#v4_22>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:22</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v6_17>1&nbsp;Cor. 6:17</a>).
