Impartation is based on identification; without identification, there is no basis for imparting something. Through identification, signified by the laying on of the hands of the elders and the apostle Paul (<a href=2Ti.htm#v1_6>2&nbsp;Tim. 1:6</a>), the gift of grace was imparted to Timothy."

Then death will be swallowed up unto victory. This is the consummation of the resurrection we share in God&rsquo;s economy through the redemption and salvation in Christ. This resurrection begins with the enlivening of our dead spirit and is completed with the transfiguration of our corruptible body. Between these two ends is the process in which our fallen soul is metabolically transformed by the life-giving Spirit, who is the reality of resurrection (<a href=2Co.htm#v3_18>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18</a>)."
