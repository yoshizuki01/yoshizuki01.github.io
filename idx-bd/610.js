BD["75F\x97"]="<b>cleansed</b><br> &emsp; Nehemiah, with the help of Ezra, fully reconstituted the returned captives of the nation of Israel (<a href=Neh.htm#v8_1>8:1</a>&mdash;<a href=Neh.htm#v13_31>13:31</a>). Consequently, Israel became a particular nation, a nation that was sanctified and separated unto God and that expressed God. They were transfused with the thought of God, with the considerations of God, and with all that God is, making them God&rsquo;s reproduction. As a result, they became a divine nation on earth expressing the divine character. They were reconstituted personally and corporately to be God&rsquo;s testimony.<br> &emsp; The central and crucial point of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah is the matter of proper, adequate leadership. Whereas the record of the leadership in Judges, 1 and 2&nbsp;Samuel, 1 and 2&nbsp;Kings, and 1 and 2&nbsp;Chronicles is, for the most part, dark, the record in Ezra and Nehemiah is altogether bright. In the books of Ezra and Nehemiah three leaders are mentioned: Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah. They were all excellent leaders, but the best and the highest was Nehemiah. Only under the leadership of persons like Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah could Israel be reconstituted to be the testimony, the expression, of God on earth, a people absolutely different from the Gentile nations. Such a testimony of God is a type of what God wants the church to be today."

BD["=+.\x97"]="<b>Who</b><br> &emsp; In the third stage of her experience the lover of Christ is called to live in ascension as the new creation in resurrection. To live in ascension is to live continually in our spirit. Although we, the believers in Christ, are on earth, when we are in our spirit, we are joined to the ascended Christ in the heavens (see <a href=HebN.htm#n10_19x1>note 19<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v10>Heb. 10</a>). To live in ascension requires that we live, act, move, and do everything in our spirit (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_4>Rom. 8:4</a>). This requires that we discern our spirit from our soul (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_12>Heb. 4:12</a>)."
BD["a,4\x98"]="<b>soul</b><br> &emsp; According to the Bible, man is a tripartite being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body (<a href=1Th.htm#v5_23>1&nbsp;Thes. 5:23</a>). Here, in this verse, are the joints and marrow&mdash;which are parts of the body&mdash;and the soul and spirit.<br> &emsp; The foregoing verses describe the children of Israel as falling away from entering into the rest of the good land. With them there were three places: (1) Egypt, from which they were delivered; (2) the wilderness, in which they wandered; and (3) Canaan, into which they entered. Their history in these three places signifies the three stages of their participation in God&rsquo;s full salvation. This is a type of us, the New Testament believers, in our participation in the full salvation of God. In the first stage we receive Christ and are redeemed and delivered from the world. In the second stage we become wanderers in following the Lord; our wandering always takes place in our soul. In the third stage we partake of and enjoy Christ in a full way; this is experienced in our spirit. When we pursue the pleasures of material and sinful things, we are in the world, typified by Egypt. When we wander in our soul, we are in the wilderness. When we enjoy Christ in our spirit, we are in Canaan. When the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness, they were always murmuring, reasoning, and chiding. This surely took place in their soul, not in their spirit. But Caleb and Joshua believed in the word of God, obeyed the Lord, and pressed toward the goal. This surely took place not in their soul but in their spirit. At that time the receivers of this book, the Hebrew believers, were wondering what they should do with their old Hebrew religion. This wondering in their mind was a wandering in their soul, not an experience of Christ in their spirit. So the writer of this book said that the word of God, i.e., what was quoted from the Old Testament, could pierce into their wondering like a sharp two-edged sword and divide their soul from their spirit. As the marrow is concealed deep in the joints, so the spirit is deep in the soul. The dividing of the marrow from the joints requires mainly the breaking of the joints. In the same principle, the dividing of the spirit from the soul requires the breaking of the soul. The Hebrew believers&rsquo; soul, with its wondering mind, its doubting concerning God&rsquo;s way of salvation, and its considering of its own interests, had to be broken by the living, operative, and piercing word of God that their spirit might be divided from their soul.<br> &emsp; Our soul is our very self (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_25>Matt. 16:25</a>; cf. <a href=Luk.htm#v9_25>Luke 9:25</a>). In following the Lord we must deny our soul, our very self (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_24>Matt. 16:24</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v9_23>Luke 9:23</a>). Our spirit is the deepest part of our being, a spiritual organ with which we contact God (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_24>John 4:24</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v1_9>Rom. 1:9</a>). It is in our spirit that we are regenerated (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_6>John 3:6</a>). It is in our spirit that the Holy Spirit dwells and works (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_16>Rom. 8:16</a>). It is in our spirit that we enjoy Christ and His grace (<a href=2Ti.htm#v4_22>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:22</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v6_18>Gal. 6:18</a>). Hence, the writer of this book advised the Hebrew believers not to stagger in the wandering of their soul, which soul they had to deny, but to press on into their spirit to partake of and enjoy the heavenly Christ that they might participate in the kingdom rest of His reign in the millennium. If they staggered in the wandering of their soul, they would miss God&rsquo;s goal and suffer the loss of the full enjoyment of Christ and the kingdom rest."
BD["=*1\x97"]="<b>wall</b><br> &emsp; In the first stage of her progressive experience of Christ, the lover of Christ pursues Him (<a href=SoS.htm#v1_2>1:2</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v1_4>4a</a>), receives help in the fellowship in the inner chambers (<a href=SoS.htm#v1_4>1:4b</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v1_6>6a</a>), and enters into the church life (<a href=SoS.htm#v1_6>1:6b</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v1_8>8</a>), where she experiences transformation (<a href=SoS.htm#v1_9>1:9</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v1_16>16a</a>; <a href=SoS.htm#v2_1>2:1</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v2_3>3a</a>) and enters into the rest and enjoyment of Christ for her full satisfaction (<a href=SoS.htm#v1_16>1:16b</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v1_17>17</a>; <a href=SoS.htm#v2_3>2:3b</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v2_7>7</a>). These attainments result in a situation in which she overcares for her spiritual condition before Christ, being too concerned about whether or not she remains in the perfection she has attained. This causes her to fall into introspection, which becomes a seclusion as a wall that keeps her away from the presence of Christ. Every spiritual person who reaches a situation of satisfaction in Christ eventually falls into introspection, not only examining the self but also analyzing it (cf. <a href=Heb.htm#v12_2>Heb. 12:2</a>). If such a condition persists, the self becomes stronger and eventually becomes the center of everything in the lover&rsquo;s life."

Here the lover of Christ is brought by Him into a feast as the expression of the initial result of the mutual gain and enjoyment of Christ and His lover in the churches. This shows the mutual enjoyment and satisfaction of Christ and His lover in the churches."

Here the sanctification of the Spirit, as the main emphasis in this chapter, an emphasis on holiness (vv. <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_15>15</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_16>16</a>), comes before obedience to Christ and faith in His redemption, i.e., before justification through Christ&rsquo;s redemption (<a href=1Co.htm#v6_11>1&nbsp;Cor. 6:11</a>), indicating that the believers&rsquo; obedience unto faith in Christ results from the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctifying work. The Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification in its various aspects is revealed in an all-inclusive way in <a href=2Th.htm#v2_13>2&nbsp;Thes. 2:13</a>, and its goal is that God&rsquo;s chosen people may obtain God&rsquo;s full salvation.
