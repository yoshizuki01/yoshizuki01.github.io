BD["(**\x97"]="<b>rested</b><br> &emsp; God rested because He had finished His work and was satisfied. God&rsquo;s glory was manifested because man had His image, and His authority was about to be exercised for the subduing of His enemy, Satan. As long as man expresses God and deals with God&rsquo;s enemy, God is satisfied and can rest.<br> &emsp; Later, the seventh day was commemorated as the Sabbath (<a href=Exo.htm#v20_8>Exo. 20:8</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v20_11>11</a>). God&rsquo;s seventh day was man&rsquo;s first day. God had prepared everything for man&rsquo;s enjoyment. After man was created, he did not join in God&rsquo;s work; he entered into God&rsquo;s rest. Man was created not to work but to be satisfied with God and rest with God (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v11_28>Matt. 11:28</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v11_30>30</a>). The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath (<a href=Mrk.htm#v2_27>Mark 2:27</a>).<br> &emsp; The rest here is a seed that develops through the Bible and is harvested in Revelation. The development of this seed includes the rest of the Sabbath day (<a href=Exo.htm#v20_8>Exo. 20:8</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v20_11>11</a>) and the rest of the good land (<a href=Deu.htm#v12_9>Deut. 12:9</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v4_8>Heb. 4:8</a>) in the Old Testament, the rest of the Lord&rsquo;s Day in the New Testament (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_10>Rev. 1:10</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v20_7>Acts 20:7</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v16_2>1&nbsp;Cor. 16:2</a>), and the rest of the millennial kingdom (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_1>Heb. 4:1</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v4_3>3</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v4_9>9</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v4_11>11</a>). The consummation of rest is the rest of the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem, in which all the redeemed saints will express God&rsquo;s glory (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_11>Rev. 21:11</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_23>23</a>) and reign with God&rsquo;s authority (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>Rev. 22:5b</a>) for eternity.
