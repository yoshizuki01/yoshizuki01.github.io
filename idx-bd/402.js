BD["a.)\x97"]="<b>word</b><br> &emsp; Or, primary word. The word of the beginning of Christ refers to the six items mentioned in this verse and the next verse, items that constitute the foundation of the Christian life: (1) repentance from dead works, (2) faith in God, (3) the teaching of baptisms, (4) the laying on of hands, (5) the resurrection of the dead, and (6) eternal judgment. These six items form three pairs. The first item of each pair refers to our emergence from a negative situation, and the second speaks of our entering into the positive things. Repentance is a turning away from dead works; faith is the entry into God. Baptisms are separations from and terminations of the negative things; the laying on of hands is the identification and fellowship with the divine things. The resurrection of the dead is the emergence from death; eternal judgment is the entry into eternity and the eternal destiny."

BD["`)A\x97"]="<b>grace</b><br> &emsp; The apostle always greeted the recipients of his Epistles, in both the opening and the conclusion, with the grace of the Lord. This shows that he trusted in the Lord&rsquo;s grace, being confident that this grace would enable them, as well as himself (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_10>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:10</a>), to accomplish what he wrote to them. No human effort avails for the accomplishing of a revelation as high as the completing revelation of the apostle Paul&mdash;for this the Lord&rsquo;s grace is needed."
