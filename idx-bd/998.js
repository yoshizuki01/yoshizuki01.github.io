BD["(Y7\x99"]="<b>tribute</b><br> &emsp; The second group of Jacob&rsquo;s sons portray the gospel, signified by Judah and fulfilled in the four Gospels; the preaching of the gospel, signified by Zebulun and fulfilled in Acts; and the church life, signified by Issachar and fulfilled in the remaining books of the New Testament. The consummation of Jacob&rsquo;s prophecy concerning Judah, Zebulun, and Issachar is seen in <a href=Deu.htm#v33_19>Deut. 33:19</a>, which says that the peoples, the nations, will be called to the mountain, signifying the kingdom of God (<a href=Dan.htm#v2_35>Dan. 2:35</a>), where they will offer sacrifices of righteousness and enjoy the abundance of the seas (the church composed mainly of Gentile believers&mdash;see <a href=MatN.htm#n13_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v13>Matt. 13</a>) and the hidden treasures of the sand (the kingdom hidden in the earth&mdash;<a href=Mat.htm#v13_44>Matt. 13:44</a>). This shows that the gospel, the preaching of the gospel, and the church life as the issue of the gospel result in the enjoyment of the church life and the kingdom life (cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v14_17>Rom. 14:17</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n14_17x1>note 1</a>)."

Yet in His wisdom and sovereignty God did not execute His judgment on Satan. God still has given Satan a certain limited time to do something to meet some negative need in the fulfillment of His economy. God could not and would not ask any of His many excellent angels to do what was needed to damage Job in order to strip him of everything so that he might be full of God. Satan was the unique one in the universe who could and who would fulfill God&rsquo;s intention of stripping Job of his possessions and his ethical attainment. Thus, the scene here and in <a href=Job.htm#v2>ch. 2</a> shows that Satan remains free to be purposely used by God as an ugly tool to execute God&rsquo;s severe dealing with his loving ones.<br> &emsp; Two thousand years after the time of Job, Jesus Christ destroyed Satan through His death on the cross (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_14>Heb. 2:14</a>). However, Satan&rsquo;s right to enter into the presence of God still has not been taken away from him (cf. <a href=Rev.htm#v12_10>Rev. 12:10</a>). This right will be taken away at the beginning of the great tribulation. When the overcomers are raptured to God&rsquo;s throne, Satan will be cast down from the heavens to the earth (<a href=Rev.htm#v12_5>Rev. 12:5</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v12_7>7</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v12_9>9</a>). From that time onward, Satan will no longer have the right to enter into the presence of God."
