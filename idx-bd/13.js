BD["a3)\x99"]="<b>hoped</b><br> &emsp; The unbelievers, being without Christ, have no hope (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_12>Eph. 2:12</a>; <a href=1Th.htm#v4_13>1&nbsp;Thes. 4:13</a>). But we, the believers in Christ, are a people of hope. The calling that we receive from God brings us hope (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_18>Eph. 1:18</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v4_4>4:4</a>). We have been regenerated unto a living hope (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:3</a>). Our Christ, who is in us, is the hope of glory (<a href=Col.htm#v1_27>Col. 1:27</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v1_1>1&nbsp;Tim. 1:1</a>), which will issue in the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body in glory (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_23>Rom. 8:23</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_25>25</a>). This is the hope of salvation (<a href=1Th.htm#v5_8>1&nbsp;Thes. 5:8</a>), a blessed hope (<a href=Tit.htm#v2_13>Titus 2:13</a>), a good hope (<a href=2Th.htm#v2_16>2&nbsp;Thes. 2:16</a>), the hope of eternal life (<a href=Tit.htm#v1_2>Titus 1:2</a>; <a href=Tit.htm#v3_7>3:7</a>); it is also the hope of the glory of God (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_2>Rom. 5:2</a>), the hope of the gospel (<a href=Col.htm#v1_23>Col. 1:23</a>), the hope laid up for us in the heavens (<a href=Col.htm#v1_5>Col. 1:5</a>). We should keep this hope always (<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_3>1&nbsp;John 3:3</a>) and boast in it (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_2>Rom. 5:2</a>). Our God is the God of hope (<a href=Rom.htm#v15_13>Rom. 15:13</a>), and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we can have hope (<a href=Rom.htm#v15_4>Rom. 15:4</a>) all the time in God (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_21>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:21</a>) and can rejoice in it (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_12>Rom. 12:12</a>). This book charges us to hold fast the boast of hope firm to the end (<a href=Heb.htm#v3_6>3:6</a>), to show diligence unto the full assurance of our hope until the end (<a href=Heb.htm#v6_11>6:11</a>), and to lay hold of the hope set before us (<a href=Heb.htm#v6_18>6:18</a>). It also tells us that the new covenant brings in a better hope, through which we draw near to God (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_19>7:19</a>). Our life should be a life of hope, which accompanies and abides with faith (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_21>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:21</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v13_13>1&nbsp;Cor. 13:13</a>). We should follow Abraham, who beyond hope believed in hope (<a href=Rom.htm#v4_18>Rom. 4:18</a>)."
