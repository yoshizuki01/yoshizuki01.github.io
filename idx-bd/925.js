BD[">B5\x97"]="<b>lords</b><br> &emsp; Because Israel had become rebellious, God used the nations to discipline them. But the action of the nations was excessive; they went too far, overstepping the limit set by God. In assuming to be lords and acting as if they were the master, the nations went too far. Thus, God judges them and punishes them (vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v26_5>5</a>, <a href=Isa.htm#v26_14>14</a>, <a href=Isa.htm#v26_21>21</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v24_21>24:21</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v24_22>22</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v25_2>25:2</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v25_3>3</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v27_1>27:1</a>).<br> &emsp; God&rsquo;s chastising of Israel and His judgment on the nations who exercise excessive action upon Israel issues in three things: (1) Israel is brought back to God; (2) the created things are restored; and (3) the all-inclusive Christ is ushered in. When Israel turns to God, there will be the restoration of all things. Then the all-inclusive Christ will be ushered in. This is the basic and governing principle of Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy, especially in the first thirty-nine chapters."

About 470 years after Korah&rsquo;s rebellion, Samuel the prophet, Heman the singer, and some other psalmists came forth as Korah the rebel&rsquo;s descendants at the time of David (<a href=1Ch.htm#v6_31>1&nbsp;Chron. 6:31</a>-<a href=1Ch.htm#v6_37>37</a>). The descendants of Korah continued to serve during the time of the captivity. Even the descendants of a leading rebel could become the godly writers of psalms, praising God in their holy writings as a record that has existed for generations. What a grace this was!"

In His judgment God discharged, or &ldquo;fired,&rdquo; everyone and everything, including the kings of the nations, Shebna the steward, and all the bowls and jars in God&rsquo;s house, and replaced them all with Christ. God discharged everyone on the cross, and He is replacing everyone with Christ. Because Christ joined Himself to us, uniting Himself with us, when He died on the cross, we died with Him and were terminated (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_6>Rom. 6:6</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v5_14>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:14</a>). Now, in our organic union with Christ through our faith in Him, He replaces us by living in us, with us, by us, and through us (<a href=Joh.htm#v15_5>John 15:5</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v11_17>Rom. 11:17</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v1_19>Phil. 1:19</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>21a</a>). Furthermore, God has replaced everything in His Old Testament economy with Christ (<a href=Mat.htm#v17_3>Matt. 17:3</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v17_5>5</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v2_16>Col. 2:16</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v2_17>17</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_5>Heb. 10:5</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_14>14</a>). Thus, the all-inclusive Christ as Immanuel (<a href=Isa.htm#v7_14>7:14</a>) replaces everything and becomes everything in God&rsquo;s economy."

But in the dispensation from Christ to the millennial kingdom, everything is a mystery.

This indicates that God is perfect and kind in dealing with those who love Him. Even today, after God deals with us by stripping us and consuming us, and after His purpose is accomplished, God gives us His physical blessings. However, God&rsquo;s purpose in dealing with His people is not to give physical blessings to them but to give Himself to them as their eternal portion, which ultimately consummates in the New Jerusalem. The all-embracing aggregate, the totality, of the divine blessing given by God to His people is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_14>Gal. 3:14</a>)."

Israel&rsquo;s transformation as described in vv. <a href=Hos.htm#v14_4>4</a>-<a href=Hos.htm#v14_7>7</a> is based on the factor of love in life (see <a href=HosN.htm#n11_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Hos.htm#v11>ch. 11</a>). Love in affection does not transform, but love in life transforms people through the growth in life. Our relationship with God is of the divine, eternal life of God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_11>1&nbsp;John 5:11</a>). This life enlivens us, regenerates us, sanctifies us positionally and dispositionally, renews us, transforms us, conforms us, matures us, and glorifies us, making us the same as God in life, nature, appearance, and glory. At the beginning of this book Israel was a harlot, but at the end of this book, Israel has become a son (<a href=Hos.htm#v11_1>11:1</a>). Thus, the outcome of this book is transformation in life by God&rsquo;s love (cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v8_28>Rom. 8:28</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_39>39</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v12_5>Heb. 12:5</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v12_10>10</a>)."
