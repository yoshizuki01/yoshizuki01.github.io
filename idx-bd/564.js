BD["O)*\x99"]="<b>Judah</b><br> &emsp; The birthright of the promised seed consists of the double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship. Reuben, as the firstborn son of Jacob, should have inherited the birthright. But because of his defilement he lost the birthright (<a href=Gen.htm#v49_3>Gen. 49:3</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v49_4>4</a>; <a href=1Ch.htm#v5_1>1&nbsp;Chron. 5:1</a>-<a href=1Ch.htm#v5_2>2</a>). The double portion of the land went to Joseph through his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim (<a href=Jos.htm#v16>Josh. 16</a>&mdash;<a href=Jos.htm#v17>17</a>); the priesthood went to Levi (<a href=Deu.htm#v33_8>Deut. 33:8</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v33_10>10</a>); and the kingship was given to Judah (<a href=Gen.htm#v49_10>Gen. 49:10</a>; <a href=1Ch.htm#v5_2>1&nbsp;Chron. 5:2</a>). Hence, Christ, the King of God&rsquo;s kingdom, is a descendant of Judah (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_14>Heb. 7:14</a>); as such, He inherits the kingdom."
BD["(+6\x98"]="<b>stomach</b><br> &emsp; This implies that God limited Satan&rsquo;s activity and move to the earth. As long as we set our mind on the things that are above the earth, the serpent, the Devil, Satan, cannot touch us (<a href=Col.htm#v3_1>Col. 3:1</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v3_3>3</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_18>1&nbsp;John 5:18</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v16_20>Rom. 16:20</a>)."

BD["()<\x98"]="<b>birds</b><br> &emsp; The bird life is higher than the fish life. Fish can live in the death waters, but birds can transcend the death waters. By growing further in the divine life, the believers are able to transcend all the frustrations of the earth (cf. <a href=Isa.htm#v40_31>Isa. 40:31</a>). The bird life typifies the riches of the life of Christ as seen in His being the eagle for carrying God&rsquo;s redeemed to His destination (<a href=Exo.htm#v19_4>Exo. 19:4</a>; <a href=Deu.htm#v32_11>Deut. 32:11</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v32_12>12</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v12_14>Rev. 12:14</a>) and in His being the turtledoves or pigeons for offering to God for the sins of God&rsquo;s people (<a href=Lev.htm#v1_14>Lev. 1:14</a>; <a href=Lev.htm#v5_7>5:7</a>)."

BD["*)*\x98"]="<b>cattle</b><br> &emsp; All the kinds of cattle used in burnt offerings in this chapter were living animals that move and act according to their will. Christ was such a living one, with a strong will but with His will subdued to be subject to God. He never became blemished (<a href=Lev.htm#v1_3>v. 3</a>) because His will was always subdued to be subject to God&rsquo;s will (<a href=Joh.htm#v5_30>John 5:30</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v6_38>6:38</a>). As the burnt offering Christ went to the cross in order to do the will of God (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_5>Heb. 10:5</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_10>10</a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n10_7x2>note 7<sup>2</sup></a>)."
