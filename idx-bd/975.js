BD["b()"]="Author: James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ; the Lord's flesh brother (<a href=Jam.htm#v1_1>1:1</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v13_55>Matt. 13:55</a>).<br>Time of Writing: Perhaps around A.D. 50, prior to the decline of the church, which is never alluded to in this book.<br>Place of Writing: Probably Jerusalem, from which James apparently never departed.<br>Recipients: The twelve tribes in dispersion (see <a href=Jam.htm#v1_1>1:1</a> and notes <a href=JamN.htm#n1_1x3>3</a> and <a href=JamN.htm#n1_1x4>4</a>)."

BD[":\xac6\x98"]="<b>resting</b><br> &emsp; <a href=Psa.htm#v132>Psalm 132</a> mentions seven items related to the overcomers: resting with God, dwelling with God (<a href=Psa.htm#v132_14>v. 14</a>), food for satisfaction (<a href=Psa.htm#v132_15>v. 15</a>), glorious clothing (<a href=Psa.htm#v132_16>v. 16</a>), the horn of victory (<a href=Psa.htm#v132_17>v. 17</a>), the enlightening lamp (<a href=Psa.htm#v132_17>v. 17</a>), and the shining crown (<a href=Psa.htm#v132_18>v. 18</a>). These items are at the top of the church life. They portray the situation of the overcomers in Zion, the highest peak of God&rsquo;s mountain."
BD["B)*\x97"]="<b>Shinar</b><br> &emsp; The origin of Babylon was Babel in the land of Shinar, which is Chaldea (<a href=Gen.htm#v11_2>Gen. 11:2</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v11_9>9</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v11_28>28</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v1_1>Dan. 1:1</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v1_2>2</a>, <a href=Dan.htm#v1_4>4</a>). For the children of Israel to be taken captive to Babylon means that they were captured back to the place of the worship of idols (<a href=Jer.htm#v50_1>Jer. 50:1</a>, <a href=Jer.htm#v50_38>38</a>), i.e., back to Babel, to the original place where their forefather Abraham had worshipped idols (<a href=Jos.htm#v24_2>Josh. 24:2</a>-<a href=Jos.htm#v24_3>3</a>). Abraham was called by God out of Chaldea to Canaan to worship God (<a href=Act.htm#v7_2>Acts 7:2</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v7_4>4</a>). By this, the worship of the unique God, which had been lost through Adam&rsquo;s fall, was resumed (<a href=Gen.htm#v12_5>Gen. 12:5</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v12_8>8</a>). Eventually, because of their degradation God&rsquo;s people were taken back to the very place out of which Abraham had been called. See notes <a href=JerN.htm#n50_1x1P1>1<sup>1</sup>, par. 1</a>, and <a href=JerN.htm#n50_15x1>15<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Jer.htm#v50>Jer. 50</a>."

BD["a5<\x98"]="<b>eternal</b><br> &emsp; This book does not concern temporal things, such as the things of the old covenant, but eternal things, things that are beyond the limit of time and space, such as eternal salvation (<a href=Heb.htm#v5_9>5:9</a>), eternal judgment (<a href=Heb.htm#v6_2>6:2</a>), eternal redemption (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_12>9:12</a>), the eternal Spirit (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_14>9:14</a>), the eternal inheritance (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_15>9:15</a>), and the eternal covenant (<a href=Heb.htm#v13_20>13:20</a>).<br> &emsp; The new covenant is not only a better covenant (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_22>7:22</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v8_6>8:6</a>) but also an eternal covenant. It is eternally effective because of the eternal efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s blood, with which it was enacted (<a href=Mat.htm#v26_28>Matt. 26:28</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v22_20>Luke 22:20</a>)."

BD["a3B\x98"]="<b>reproach</b><br> &emsp; Christ, as the Angel of the Lord, was always with the children of Israel in their afflictions (<a href=Exo.htm#v3_2>Exo. 3:2</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v3_7>7</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v3_9>9</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v14_19>14:19</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v20_16>Num. 20:16</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v63_9>Isa. 63:9</a>). Furthermore, the Scripture identifies Him with them (<a href=Hos.htm#v11_1>Hosea 11:1</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v2_15>Matt. 2:15</a>). Hence, the reproach falling on them was considered His reproach, and the reproaches of those who reproached God fell also on Him (<a href=Rom.htm#v15_3>Rom. 15:3</a>). The New Testament believers, as His followers, bear His reproach (<a href=Heb.htm#v13_13>13:13</a>) and are reproached for His name (<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_14>1&nbsp;Pet. 4:14</a>). Moses, choosing to be ill treated with the people of God (<a href=Heb.htm#v11_25>v. 25</a>), considered this kind of reproach, the reproach of the Christ of God, greater riches than the treasures of Egypt in Pharaoh&rsquo;s palace; for Moses looked away to the reward."

BD["a2E\x98"]="<b>trampled</b><br> &emsp; In the new covenant the Son of God replaces all the sacrifices of the old covenant. If the Hebrew believers had returned to Judaism to offer any of the old sacrifices, they would have been, in effect, trampling underfoot the Son of God."
