The truth is not the so-called truth of doctrine but the reality of the divine things, which is the Lord Himself (see <a href=JohN.htm#n14_6x2>note 6<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Joh.htm#v14>ch. 14</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>1:14</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_17>17</a>). This verse says that &ldquo;the truth shall set you free,&rdquo; whereas <a href=Joh.htm#v8_36>v. 36</a> says that &ldquo;the Son sets you free.&rdquo; This proves that the Son, the Lord Himself, is the truth. Since the Lord is the embodiment of God (<a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>), He is the reality of what God is. Hence, reality is the very divine element of God realized by us. When the Lord as the great I Am comes into us as life, He shines within us as light, bringing the divine element as reality into us. This reality, which is the divine element imparted into us and realized by us, sets us free from the bondage of sin by the divine life as the light of man. When the Lord as the Word of God became flesh (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>1:14</a>), He brought God to us as this reality, that God might be the grace for our enjoyment (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_17>1:17</a>)."
