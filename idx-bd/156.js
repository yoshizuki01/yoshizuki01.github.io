BD["c--\x98"]="<b>gird</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word is derived from a noun meaning a slave&rsquo;s apron; such an apron girded up the slave&rsquo;s loose garments in the service. It is used here as a figure of speech, signifying the putting on of humility as a virtue in service. This figure came evidently from Peter&rsquo;s impression of how the Lord girded Himself with a towel when He humbled Himself to wash the disciples&rsquo; feet, especially Peter&rsquo;s (<a href=Joh.htm#v13_4>John 13:4</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v13_7>7</a>).

BD["c)9\x98"]="<b>judges</b><br> &emsp; Peter &ldquo;is not speaking of the final judgment of the soul. In that sense \x91the Father judgeth no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son&rsquo; [<a href=Joh.htm#v5_22>John 5:22</a>]. The thing spoken of here is the daily judgment of God&rsquo;s government in this world, exercised with regard to His children. Accordingly it says, \x91the time of your sojourn[ing]&rsquo; here&rdquo; (Darby). This is God&rsquo;s judgment on His own household (<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_17>4:17</a>).<br> &emsp; Since these two Epistles are concerned with the government of God, the judgment of God and of the Lord is referred to repeatedly (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_23>2:23</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v4_5>4:5</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_6>6</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v4_17>17</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_3>2&nbsp;Pet. 2:3</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_4>4</a>, <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_9>9</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_7>3:7</a>) as one of the main items. God&rsquo;s judgment began from the angels (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_3>2&nbsp;Pet. 2:3</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_4>4</a>) and passed through the generations of man in the Old Testament (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_5>2&nbsp;Pet. 2:5</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_9>9</a>). In the New Testament age it begins from the house of God (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_17>v. 17</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_23>2:23</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v4_6>4:6</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v4_17>17</a>) and continues until the coming of the day of the Lord (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_10>2&nbsp;Pet. 3:10</a>), which will be a day of judgment on the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles before the millennium (see <a href=2PeN.htm#n3_12x3>note 12<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=2Pe.htm#v3>2&nbsp;Pet. 3</a>). After the millennium all the dead, including men and demons, will be judged and will perish (<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_5>4:5</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_7>2&nbsp;Pet. 3:7</a>), and the heavens and the earth will be consumed by fire (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_10>2&nbsp;Pet. 3:10b</a>, <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_12>12</a>). The results of the various judgments are not the same. Some judgments result in a disciplinary dealing, some in a dispensational punishment, and some in eternal perdition (see <a href=2PeN.htm#n2_1x5P3>note 1<sup>5</sup>, point 2</a>, in <a href=2Pe.htm#v2>2&nbsp;Pet. 2</a>). However, by all these judgments the Lord God will clear up and purify the entire universe that He may have a new heaven and a new earth for a new universe filled with His righteousness (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_13>2&nbsp;Pet. 3:13</a>) for His delight."
