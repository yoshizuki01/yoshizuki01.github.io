Hence, Paul exhorted them not to abandon their own assembling together as Christians."

Therefore, from this verse through <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_24>v. 24</a> the apostle proceeds from righteousness to love in the manifestation of the children of God, as a further condition of the life that abides in the Lord."

A calf&rsquo;s foot is also cloven, divided, signifying that in their walk the living creatures can discern what is right and what is wrong and what is clean and what is unclean in the eyes of God (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_9>Phil. 1:9</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v1_10>10</a>; cf. <a href=LevN.htm#n11_3x1>note 3<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Lev.htm#v11>Lev. 11</a>). That the feet of the living creatures sparkled like the sight of burnished bronze signifies that their walk has been tested and examined by the Lord and that it shines, giving light to others and being a test to their walk (cf. <a href=RevN.htm#n1_15x1>note 15<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v1>Rev. 1</a>).<br> &emsp; A calf signifies freshness, livingness, and vigor (cf. <a href=Psa.htm#v29_6>Psa. 29:6</a>; <a href=Mal.htm#v4_2>Mal. 4:2</a>). The walk of the living creatures is vigorous, full of life, freshness, and newness, like a young calf (cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v6_4>Rom. 6:4</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v7_6>7:6</a>)."

The prophet&rsquo;s reaction was very tender, sympathetic, and compassionate.<br> &emsp; According to this book, God&rsquo;s love is a composition of His tender care, compassion, and sympathy. Even while He chastises His elect people Israel, He is compassionate toward them (<a href=Lam.htm#v3_22>Lam. 3:22</a>-<a href=Lam.htm#v3_23>23</a>). In His chastising of Israel, God can be compared to a father who weeps as he disciplines his child because he loves the child. In this book Jeremiah wept on God&rsquo;s behalf; his weeping expressed God&rsquo;s feeling. We may say that God wept within Jeremiah&rsquo;s weeping, for in his weeping Jeremiah was one with God. Because Jeremiah often wept (<a href=Jer.htm#v13_17>13:17</a>; <a href=Lam.htm#v2_11>Lam. 2:11</a>; <a href=Lam.htm#v3_48>3:48</a>), even wailed, he is called the weeping prophet."
