Such an all-inclusive Spirit is crucial to the ministers of Christ and to their ministry for God&rsquo;s new covenant economy.<br> &emsp; After speaking about the ministry of the new covenant, the apostle spoke about the ministers of the new covenant.

Through such a process of transformation they are constituted ministers of Christ by the Spirit with the elements of Christ&rsquo;s person and work.
