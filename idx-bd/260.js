BD["d+-\x97"]="<b>this</b><br> &emsp; Or, this is hidden from them by their own willfulness. I.e., they are willfully ignorant of this; hence, this escapes their notice. The heretical mockers ignore willfully and deny purposely the word of God spoken by the prophets in the Scriptures. So Peter reminded the believers to remember the holy words spoken by both the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles (vv. <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_1>1</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_2>2</a>)."
BD["b*B\x97"]="<b>spirit</b><br> &emsp; The spirit gives life to the body (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_7>Gen. 2:7</a>); the works indicate and express the life that is in the faith."

It will be a reward to His faithful believers, who pursue the growth in His life unto maturity and the development of the virtues of His nature that in the millennium they may participate in His kingship in God&rsquo;s glory (<a href=2Ti.htm#v2_12>2&nbsp;Tim. 2:12</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>Rev. 20:4</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>). To enter thus into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is related to entering into God&rsquo;s eternal glory, to which God has called us in Christ (<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_10>1&nbsp;Pet. 5:10</a>; <a href=1Th.htm#v2_12>1&nbsp;Thes. 2:12</a> and notes <a href=1ThN.htm#n2_12x2>2</a> and <a href=1ThN.htm#n2_12x3>3</a>)."
BD["c-0\x97"]="<b>sober</b><br> &emsp; To be sober is to have a clear mind of sobriety and self-control that we may know, especially as disclosed in this chapter, God&rsquo;s purpose in disciplining us and His enemy&rsquo;s scheme to destroy us. See <a href=1PeN.htm#n4_7x3>note 7<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=1Pe.htm#v4>ch. 4</a>."
BD["c-/\x9a"]="<b>it</b><br> &emsp; Or, He cares for you. The disciplining and judging God has a loving concern for the believers, especially the persecuted ones. He cares for them faithfully. They can throw their care on Him, especially in their persecution."

BD["c,3\x97"]="<b>oracles</b><br> &emsp; The divine speakings or utterances as revelations. In the ministry of grace, as mentioned in <a href=1Pe.htm#v4_10>v. 10</a>, our speaking should be God&rsquo;s speaking, God&rsquo;s utterance, which conveys divine revelation."
BD[":\xa9-\x97"]="<b>hate</b><br> &emsp; <a href=Psa.htm#v129>Psalm 129</a> is the praise of a saint, in his going up to Zion, concerning God&rsquo;s righteous dealing with the persecutors of Israel and the haters of Zion. Here Israel signifies the New Testament believers (<a href=Gal.htm#v6_16>Gal. 6:16</a>), and Zion signifies the overcomers in the church (see <a href=PsaN.htm#n48_2x1>note 2<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Psa.htm#v48>Psa. 48</a>). The more we love the Lord Jesus, the more we will be hated and persecuted (<a href=Joh.htm#v15_18>John 15:18</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v15_20>20a</a>)."
BD["a4-\x97"]="<b>discipline</b><br> &emsp; Or, chastening. So in vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v12_7>7</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v12_8>8</a>, and <a href=Heb.htm#v12_11>11</a>."
BD["c*9\x97"]="<b>brotherhood</b><br> &emsp; The aggregate of the brothers, the family of the brothers, the brothers in the feeling of brotherliness (also in <a href=1Pe.htm#v5_9>5:9</a>)."
BD["a30\x97"]="<b>not</b><br> &emsp; This afforded Abraham constant opportunity to exercise his faith to trust in God for His instant leading, taking God&rsquo;s presence as the map for his traveling."
BD["c)<\x97"]="<b>foreknown</b><br> &emsp; Christ was foreordained, prepared, by God to be the redeeming Lamb (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>John 1:29</a>) for His elect according to His foreknowledge before the foundation of the world. This was done according to God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and plan; it did not happen accidentally. Hence, in the eternal view of God, from the foundation of the world, that is, from the fall of man as part of the world, Christ was slain (<a href=Rev.htm#v13_8>Rev. 13:8</a>)."
BD["a23\x97"]="<b>stands</b><br> &emsp; The priests in the old covenant stood daily and offered the same sacrifices again and again, because what they offered could never remove sins. But Christ put away sin (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_26>9:26</a>) by offering Himself to God as the one sacrifice for sins, whereupon He sat down forever on the right hand of God (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_12>v. 12</a>). His sitting in heaven is a sign and proof that the removing of sins has been accomplished. His sitting there is forever. Hence, He no longer needs to do anything for sin. He did it once for all. His sitting down forever after having offered one sacrifice for sins is in contrast to the priests&rsquo; standing daily to offer often the same sacrifices."
BD["b-9\x97"]="<b>earnestly</b><br> &emsp; Lit., prayed in prayer. This indicates that a prayer from the Lord was given to Elijah, in which he prayed. He did not pray in his feeling, thought, intention, or mood, or in any kind of motivation, arising from circumstances or situations, to fulfill his own purpose. He prayed in the prayer given to him by the Lord for the accomplishing of His will."
BD["e)*\x97"]="<b>life</b><br> &emsp; This indicates that life is a synonym for Word of life in the preceding verse. Both denote the divine person of Christ, who was with the Father in eternity and was manifested in time through incarnation, and whom the apostles saw and testified and reported to the believers."
BD["a16\x97"]="<b>blood</b><br> &emsp; The blood of Christ was shed for the forgiveness of sins (<a href=Mat.htm#v26_28>Matt. 26:28</a>), and the new covenant was consummated with it (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_29>10:29</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v22_20>Luke 22:20</a>). It accomplished an eternal redemption for us (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_12>v. 12</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v1_7>Eph. 1:7</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_18>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:18</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_19>19</a>) and purchased the church for God (<a href=Act.htm#v20_28>Acts 20:28</a>). It washes us from our sins (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_7>1&nbsp;John 1:7</a>), purifies our conscience (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_14>v. 14</a>), sanctifies us (<a href=Heb.htm#v13_12>13:12</a>), and speaks something better for us (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_24>12:24</a>). By this blood we enter the Holy of Holies (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_19>10:19</a>) and overcome Satan the accuser (<a href=Rev.htm#v12_10>Rev. 12:10</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v12_11>11</a>). Therefore, it is precious and better than the blood of goats and bulls (vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v9_12>12</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v9_13>13</a>). We must value it highly and should not regard it a common thing, like animal blood. If we do, we will suffer God&rsquo;s punishment (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_29>10:29</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_31>31</a>)."
BD["e))\x9a"]="<b>handled</b><br> &emsp; First, have heard, then have seen; after having seen, beheld, gazed at with a purpose, and handled, touched with hands. These expressions indicate that the Word of life is not only mysterious but also tangible, because He was incarnated. The mysterious Word of life was touched by man, not only in His humanity before His resurrection (<a href=Mrk.htm#v3_10>Mark 3:10</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v5_31>5:31</a>) but also in His spiritual body (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_44>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:44</a>) after His resurrection (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_17>John 20:17</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v20_27>27</a>). At that time there was a heresy that denied the incarnation of the Son of God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v4_1>4:1</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v4_3>3</a>). Hence, such strong expressions to indicate the Lord&rsquo;s solid substance in His touchable humanity were needed."
