He refers here to God&rsquo;s eternal being and His eternal and unchanging government. Jerusalem was overthrown, the temple was burned down, and God&rsquo;s people were carried away, but Jehovah, the Lord of the universe, remains to exercise His administration.<br> &emsp; God&rsquo;s eternal being and His throne are higher than His lovingkindness, compassions, and faithfulness (<a href=Lam.htm#v3_22>3:22</a>-<a href=Lam.htm#v3_23>23</a>). God&rsquo;s lovingkindness and compassions can fluctuate, but God&rsquo;s person and His government remain unchanging forever. In the New Jerusalem, God will be fully unveiled in His person as the eternal King and in His government as His eternal, unshakable kingdom (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_28>Heb. 12:28</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_3>Rev. 22:3</a>), both of which are the unshakable foundation of His dealing with His people."

It is like the repeated painting of some article: the paint not only indicates the color, but also by coat upon coat being added, the elements of the paint are added to the thing painted. It is in this way that the Triune God is transfused, infused, and added into all the inward parts of our being that our inner man may grow in the divine life with the divine elements."
