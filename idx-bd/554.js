BD[")F)\x97"]="<b>altar</b><br> &emsp; The incense altar signifies Christ as the Intercessor to maintain the relationship between God and His people (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_34>Rom. 8:34</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v7_25>Heb. 7:25</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v8_3>Rev. 8:3</a>). The arrangement of the tabernacle with its furnishings is an accurate and detailed picture of God&rsquo;s administration, God&rsquo;s economy, in the universe. According to this picture the Ark is the focus, but in practice the incense altar is the center. The interceding Christ is the center of the execution of God&rsquo;s government on earth. According to <a href=Rev.htm#v8_3>Rev. 8:3</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v8_6>6</a>, the intercessor is not merely the individual Christ but the corporate Christ, the Head with the Body. Christ as the Head is interceding in the heavens, and the church as the Body is interceding on earth (<a href=1Ti.htm#v2_1>1&nbsp;Tim. 2:1</a>).<br> &emsp; In Exodus the incense altar is revealed after the tabernacle and its furniture and the equipping of the priesthood are revealed. This indicates that the priestly service begins at the incense altar, at the place where prayers of intercession are offered to God (<a href=Luk.htm#v1_10>Luke 1:10</a>). The incense altar is the place from which the activities at all the other places in the tabernacle are motivated. It is not merely one item on the passageway through the tabernacle. Rather, it can be compared to a motor that causes everything to operate. Hence, in our experience of the tabernacle (see <a href=HebN.htm#n9_4x3>note 4<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v9>Heb. 9</a>), the incense altar stands by itself as a turning point. It makes all the aspects of the tabernacle and the outer court effective in our experience. The prayer of intercession also motivates others to come to Christ at the altar of burnt offering, at the laver, at the table, at the lampstand, and at the Ark in the Holy of Holies. According to <a href=Rev.htm#v8_3>Rev. 8:3</a>, the incense altar is directly in front of the throne of God&rsquo;s authority, which is also the throne of grace (see <a href=RevN.htm#n4_2x2>note 2<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v4>Rev. 4</a>). The prayer offered at the incense altar, a prayer that is offered in Christ and with Christ as the incense (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n30_7x1>note 7<sup>1</sup></a>), governs God&rsquo;s dispensing of grace and motivates the execution of the divine administration. Hence, this prayer governs the universe."

Inwardly, we must allow Him to make His home in us that He may give life to our mortal body (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_11>v. 11</a>). Outwardly, we must put to death the practices of our body that we may live.

In the outer court the most prominent materials are bronze and linen. That the linen hangings were on bronze pillars that stood in bronze sockets signifies that the righteousness of God is the issue of God&rsquo;s judgment. In Christ there is the element of God&rsquo;s judgment. When we live the judged Christ, everything related to us is under God&rsquo;s judgment.
