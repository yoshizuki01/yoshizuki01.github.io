BD["N+)\x98"]="<b>Angel</b><br> &emsp; Or, Messenger. Christ&rsquo;s coming suddenly as the Angel of the covenant will be to execute upon Israel the covenant that He enacted through His death (<a href=Mat.htm#v26_28>Matt. 26:28</a>). In His first coming Christ came in the way of an Angel, a serving one (cf. <a href=Heb.htm#v1_14>Heb. 1:14</a>), to serve God in forming the new testament (<a href=Mrk.htm#v10_45>Mark 10:45</a>). When He established His table on the night in which He was betrayed, He enacted the new covenant (<a href=Luk.htm#v22_20>Luke 22:20</a>), in which God is obligated to forgive our sins and to dispense Himself into our being to be our life, our law of life, and our everything as our inward content that we may live Him (<a href=Jer.htm#v31_31>Jer. 31:31</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v31_34>34</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v8_8>Heb. 8:8</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v8_12>12</a>). As the Angel of the covenant, Christ in resurrection executes the new covenant as its surety (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_22>Heb. 7:22</a>), making it real to us by assuring us that our sins have been forgiven and by dispensing the riches of the covenanted Triune God into us. See notes <a href=JerN.htm#n31_31x1>31<sup>1</sup></a>, <a href=JerN.htm#n31_33x1>33<sup>1</sup></a>, and <a href=JerN.htm#n31_33x2>33<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Jer.htm#v31>Jer. 31</a>.<br> &emsp; Although the Lord Jesus enacted the new covenant nearly two thousand years ago, generally the Jewish people have not benefited from it. Instead, the benefit has gone to the Gentiles. However, when Christ comes back, He will come as the Angel of the covenant to execute His covenant over the repentant and believing Jews. At that time they will become beneficiaries of the new covenant."
