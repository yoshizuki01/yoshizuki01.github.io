Its being commanded to arise and devour much flesh signifies that it would devour more nations."

BD["i),\x9b"]="<b>seven</b><br> &emsp; The seven Spirits are undoubtedly the Spirit of God because They are ranked among the Triune God in vv. <a href=Rev.htm#v1_4>4</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v1_5>5</a>. As seven is the number for completion in God&rsquo;s operation, so the seven Spirits must be for God&rsquo;s move on the earth. In essence and existence, God&rsquo;s Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God&rsquo;s operation, God&rsquo;s Spirit is sevenfold. This is similar to the lampstand in <a href=Zec.htm#v4_2>Zech. 4:2</a>. In its existence it is one lampstand, but in its function it is seven lamps. At the time this book was written, the church had become degraded; the age was dark. Therefore, the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God was needed for God&rsquo;s move and work on the earth.<br> &emsp; In <a href=Mat.htm#v28_19>Matt. 28:19</a> the sequence of the Triune God is: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Here the sequence is changed. The seven Spirits of God are listed in the second place instead of the third. This reveals the importance of the intensified function of the sevenfold Spirit of God. This point is confirmed by the repeated emphasis on the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking in <a href=Rev.htm#v2_7>2:7</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v2_11>11</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v2_17>17</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v2_29>29</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v3_6>3:6</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v3_13>13</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v3_22>22</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v14_13>14:13</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_17>22:17</a>.<br> &emsp; At the opening of the other Epistles, only the Father and the Son are mentioned; from Them grace and peace are given to the receivers. Here, however, the Spirit is included; from Him grace and peace are imparted to the churches. This too indicates the crucial need of the Spirit to counteract the degradation of the church for God&rsquo;s move."
