The earth has foundations (<a href=Zec.htm#v12_1>Zech. 12:1b</a>), but it seemingly does not have anything supporting it (cf. <a href=Job.htm#v26_7>26:7b</a>).

BD["i*5\x99"]="<b>Antipas</b><br> &emsp; In Greek Antipas means against all. Antipas, a faithful witness of the Lord, stood against all that the worldly church brought in and practiced. Hence, he became a martyr of the Lord. In Greek the word for martyr is the same as that for witness. Antipas, as an anti-witness, bore an anti-testimony, a testimony against anything that deviated from the testimony of Jesus. It must have been through his anti-testimony that in his days the church in Pergamos still held fast the Lord&rsquo;s name and did not deny the proper Christian faith."

Here, however, His face shone as the sun shines in its power (cf. <a href=Dan.htm#v10_6>Dan. 10:6</a>); this shining is the judging enlightenment for bringing in the kingdom. When He was transfigured and His face shone like the sun, that was His coming in the kingdom (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_28>Matt. 16:28</a>&mdash;<a href=Mat.htm#v17_2>17:2</a>).
