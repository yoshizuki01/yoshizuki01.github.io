According to its usage in this book, pleroo denotes the filling of a vessel within, as the wind filled the house inwardly in <a href=Act.htm#v2_2>v. 2</a>, and pletho denotes the filling of persons outwardly, as the Spirit filled the disciples outwardly in this verse. The disciples were filled (pleroo) inwardly and essentially with the Spirit (<a href=Act.htm#v13_52>13:52</a>) for their Christian living, and were filled (pletho) outwardly and economically with the Spirit for their Christian ministry. The inward filling Spirit, the essential Spirit, is in the disciples (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_17>John 14:17</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_11>Rom. 8:11</a>), whereas the outward filling Spirit, the economical Spirit, is upon them (<a href=Act.htm#v1_8>1:8</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v2_17>2:17</a>). Every believer in Christ should experience both aspects of the Holy Spirit. Even Christ as a man experienced the same thing: He was born of the Holy Spirit essentially (<a href=Luk.htm#v1_35>Luke 1:35</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v1_18>Matt. 1:18</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v1_20>20</a>) for His being and living, and He was anointed with the Holy Spirit economically (<a href=Mat.htm#v3_16>Matt. 3:16</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v4_18>Luke 4:18</a>) for His ministry and move. The essential Spirit was within Him and the economical Spirit was upon Him.<br> &emsp; The outward filling of the poured out Spirit was the ascended Head&rsquo;s baptizing of His Body into the Spirit. On the day of Pentecost the Jewish believers, the first part of His Body, were baptized; in the house of Cornelius the Gentile believers, the second part of His Body, were baptized in the same way (<a href=Act.htm#v10_44>10:44</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v10_47>47</a>). By these two steps He baptized once for all His entire Body into the Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_13>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:13</a>), who is the application and realization of Himself. His baptizing His Body into the Spirit was His baptizing it into Himself. This was the accomplishment of the baptism in the Holy Spirit promised in <a href=Act.htm#v1_5>1:5</a> by Christ, the Head of the Body."

The fact that this portrait is presented after the war against Amalek signifies that when the flesh as God&rsquo;s enemy is dealt with, the kingdom with the kingship immediately comes in (cf. <a href=Gal.htm#v5_17>Gal. 5:17</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v5_25>25</a>), and the church as the Body of Christ is built up (cf. <a href=1Ki.htm#v1>1&nbsp;Kings 1</a>&mdash;<a href=1Ki.htm#v8>8</a>). In order to realize the kingdom with the building of the church, we must utterly repudiate the flesh in both its good and evil aspects (cf. <a href=Phi.htm#v3_3>Phil. 3:3</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_10>10</a>). Saul lost the kingship because he did not utterly destroy Amalek but spared the best of what was to be destroyed (<a href=1Sa.htm#v15>1&nbsp;Sam. 15</a> and <a href=1SaN.htm#n15_2x1>notes</a>).<br> &emsp; According to historical sequence, the events described in <a href=Exo.htm#v18>ch. 18</a> took place after the building of the tabernacle and not long before the children of Israel began their journey with the tabernacle toward the good land (<a href=Deu.htm#v1_6>Deut. 1:6</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v1_18>18</a>). Under divine inspiration Moses inserted these events after <a href=Exo.htm#v17>ch. 17</a> to show that in the experience of God&rsquo;s full salvation the kingdom comes after God&rsquo;s people have been delivered from Satan (Pharaoh) and the world (Egypt), and after the flesh (Amalek) has been defeated and subdued. After the defeat of Amalek, the kingdom is needed as the sphere, the environment, for the building up of God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth."

However, Abraham did not accept God&rsquo;s calling immediately but remained in Ur for some time. After the death of Haran, Abraham&rsquo;s brother (<a href=Gen.htm#v11_28>v. 28</a>), God sovereignly caused his father, Terah, to bring the family from Ur to Haran.
