The trial also includes the supernatural calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets at the beginning of the great tribulation. The Lord promised the recovered church that He would keep her out of the hour of trial (not only out of the trial, but out of the hour of trial) because she has kept the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance. This promise of the Lord, like His promise in <a href=Luk.htm#v21_36>Luke 21:36</a>, indicates that the saints who keep the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance will be raptured before the great trial, implying that those who do not keep the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance will be left in the trial."

The Lord&rsquo;s faith denotes all that we must believe in concerning the Lord&rsquo;s person and work. It does not denote the subjective faith within us, i.e., our believing, but the objective faith, i.e., the things in which we believe. Because the church entered into union with the world, she began to disregard the Lord&rsquo;s name and deny the proper Christian faith."

As God accomplishes His economy by dispensing Himself into us, He is our food, our water, and our fountain of living waters. How marvelous it is that in a portion of the Word concerned with God&rsquo;s chastisement of His sinful and evil people, such a full picture of God&rsquo;s economy accomplished by His dispensing is presented!"

BD["B*G\x97"]="<b>image</b><br> &emsp; The contents of Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream were a great human image and its destiny. The vision of the great image in this chapter is the controlling vision in the book of Daniel.

From its beginning to its termination, human government has always done three things: rebel against God, exalt man, and worship idols (<a href=Gen.htm#v11_4>Gen. 11:4</a> and <a href=GenN.htm#n11_4x2>note 2</a>)."

In His response He gave Jeremiah a further commission. The pronoun you here may be a further indication that God considered Jeremiah as being one with Israel (see vv. <a href=Jer.htm#v15_13>13</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v15_14>14</a> and <a href=JerN.htm#n15_13x1>note 13<sup>1</sup></a>).
