That God would not abandon Christ&rsquo;s soul to Sheol or let Him as God&rsquo;s Holy One see corruption indicates that Christ&rsquo;s soul would be raised up from Sheol and also that Christ&rsquo;s physical body would be resurrected from the tomb (<a href=Mat.htm#v28_6>Matt. 28:6</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v20_5>John 20:5</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v20_9>9</a>)."

BD["?)2\x97"]="<b>pluck</b><br> &emsp; The plucking up, the breaking down, and the destroying are Jehovah&rsquo;s tearing down, whereas the building up and the planting are Jehovah&rsquo;s exalting. This corresponds to the two meanings of Jeremiah&rsquo;s name (see <a href=JerN.htm#n1_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s building up and His planting both involve His word. God&rsquo;s word is a building up of Christ and a planting of Christ for the exalting of Christ (<a href=Act.htm#v20_32>Acts 20:32</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v4_14>Mark 4:14</a>)."

BD["=.5\x97"]="<b>Shulammite</b><br> &emsp; The feminine form of Solomon, derived from the root meaning peace.

This signifies that in the maturity of Christ&rsquo;s life the lover of Christ becomes the reproduction of Christ, the same as He is in life, nature, expression, and function (but not in the Godhead) to match Him for their marriage (<a href=2Co.htm#v3_18>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>Rom. 8:29</a>).<br> &emsp; This couple&rsquo;s becoming one indicates the New Jerusalem.

BD["\@))\x97"]="<b>How</b><br> &emsp; This book, written by Jeremiah, the weeping and lamenting prophet (<a href=Lam.htm#v2_11>2:11</a>; <a href=Lam.htm#v3_48>3:48</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v9_1>Jer. 9:1</a>), contains five lamentations expressing Jeremiah&rsquo;s sorrow and love for the holy city and the holy people of God. Jeremiah had prophesied concerning Israel&rsquo;s destruction carried out under God&rsquo;s governmental dealing, and he had also witnessed the destruction, devastation, contamination, capture, and ruin of the entire country, including Jerusalem. By God&rsquo;s sovereignty Jeremiah was free from captivity (<a href=Jer.htm#v40_1>Jer. 40:1</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v40_6>6</a>). According to history Jeremiah sat on a hill overlooking Jerusalem, viewing all the ruins below. He began to weep, and he could not avoid writing down his feelings.<br> &emsp; Jeremiah wrote his five lamentations in a very fine way. In Hebrew the first letter of each verse of chs. <a href=Lam.htm#v1>1</a>, <a href=Lam.htm#v2>2</a>, and <a href=Lam.htm#v4>4</a> follows the order of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. In <a href=Lam.htm#v3>ch. 3</a> every three verses form a group that begins with the same Hebrew letter, and the twenty-two groups formed follow the order of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet."

BD["e))\x98"]="<b>from</b><br> &emsp; This differs from in the beginning in John&rsquo;s Gospel (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>John 1:1</a>). In the beginning traces back to eternity past before creation; from the beginning proceeds forward from the creation. This indicates that John&rsquo;s Epistle is a continuation of his Gospel, which concerns the believers&rsquo; experience of the divine life. In his Gospel, John revealed the way for sinners to receive the eternal life&mdash;to believe in the Son of God. In his Epistle he pointed out the way for the believers, who have received the divine life, to enjoy that life in its fellowship&mdash;to abide in the Son of God. And in his Revelation he unveiled the consummation of the eternal life as the believers&rsquo; full enjoyment in eternity.<br> &emsp; The phrase from the beginning is used four times in the Gospel of John, eight times in this Epistle, and twice in 2&nbsp;John.
