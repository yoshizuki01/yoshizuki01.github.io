Therefore, the children of Israel were left to the foolish and worthless shepherds, who would not take care of them (vv. <a href=Zec.htm#v11_15>15</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v11_17>17</a>). After the crucifixion of Christ, there was no proper leadership among the people of Israel, and they were all scattered (<a href=Mat.htm#v26_31>Matt. 26:31</a>). They fought with one another, devouring one another. The foolish, worthless shepherds who rose up among them caused them further suffering. This kind of situation allowed Titus, the Roman prince, to devastate the entire country of Judah in A.D. 70 (<a href=Mat.htm#v21_33>Matt. 21:33</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v21_41>41</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n21_41x1>note 41<sup>1</sup></a>).<br> &emsp; The center of the prophecies in chs. <a href=Zec.htm#v9>9</a>&mdash;<a href=Zec.htm#v11>11</a> is Christ as the rejected Messiah.

At first, He was welcomed by the people, but later, under the influence of the elders, priests, and scribes, they changed their mind and detested Him (<a href=Zec.htm#v11_8>v. 8b</a>). The Lord Jesus was sold, judged, sentenced, and put on the cross to die (vv. <a href=Zec.htm#v11_12>12</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v11_13>13</a>). Thus, the Messiah, who was welcomed temporarily, was utterly rejected. As a result, the people of Israel were divided, persecuted by the Roman Empire, and scattered throughout the earth (vv. <a href=Zec.htm#v11_14>14</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v11_17>17</a>)."
