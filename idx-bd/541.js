BD["T2/\x97"]="<b>abyss</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word is used in <a href=Luk.htm#v8_31>Luke 8:31</a> in reference to the dwelling place of the demons; in <a href=Rev.htm#v9_1>Rev. 9:1</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v9_2>2</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v9_11>11</a> to denote the place out of which the locusts, whose king is Apollyon (Antichrist), will come; in <a href=Rev.htm#v11_7>Rev. 11:7</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v17_8>17:8</a> to signify the place out of which the beast, the Antichrist, will ascend; and in <a href=Rev.htm#v20_1>Rev. 20:1</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_3>3</a> to specify the place into which Satan will be cast and imprisoned during the millennium. The Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, uses this word for deep in <a href=Gen.htm#v1_2>Gen. 1:2</a>. Here, in this verse, it points to the place Christ visited after His death and before His resurrection, which place, according to <a href=Act.htm#v2_24>Acts 2:24</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v2_27>27</a>, is Hades; for <a href=Act.htm#v2_24>Acts 2:24</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v2_27>27</a> reveals that Christ went into Hades after He died, and rose from that place in His resurrection. Hence, according to biblical usage, the word abyss always refers to the region of death and of Satan&rsquo;s power of darkness, which is the lower parts of the earth (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_9>Eph. 4:9</a>), into which Christ descended after His death, which He conquered, and from which He ascended in His resurrection."
