His word is the word of the truth of His gospel (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_13>Eph. 1:13</a>), which tells us that He will forgive us our sins because of Christ (<a href=Act.htm#v10_43>Acts 10:43</a>); and the blood of Christ has fulfilled His righteous requirements that He might forgive us our sins (<a href=Mat.htm#v26_28>Matt. 26:28</a>). If we confess our sins, He, according to His word and based on the redemption through the blood of Jesus, forgives us because He must be faithful in His word and righteous in the blood of Jesus; otherwise, He would be unfaithful and unrighteous. Our confession is needed for His forgiveness. Such forgiveness of God, which is for the restoration of our fellowship with Him, is conditional; it depends on our confession."
