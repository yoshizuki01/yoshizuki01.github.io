This psalm mentions first the abode (<a href=Psa.htm#v45_13>v. 13</a>) and then the palace. When Christ becomes our abode, we become His abode&mdash;a mutual abode (<a href=Joh.htm#v15_4>John 15:4</a>). Because Christ is the King and we are the queen, eventually this mutual abode becomes the palace, signified by the New Jerusalem, which is actually the Triune God wrought into the believers and mingled with them to be one entity, the mutual dwelling of God and His redeemed for eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>Rev. 21:3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_22>22</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n21_22x2>note 22<sup>2</sup></a>)."

The wheat is ripe when its water content is dried up, whereas the grapes are ripe when the water has filled them up. Fully ripened indicates that the Gentiles as the grapevine are filled to the brim with their sin and that the time of their judgment has come."
