BD["i+0\x99"]="<b>word</b><br> &emsp; The Lord&rsquo;s word is the Lord&rsquo;s expression, and the Lord&rsquo;s name is the Lord Himself. The apostate church has deviated from the Lord&rsquo;s word and become heretical. The reformed church, though recovered to the Lord&rsquo;s word to some extent, has denied the Lord&rsquo;s name by denominating herself, taking many other names, such as Lutheran, Wesleyan, Anglican, Presbyterian, Baptist, etc. The recovered church not only has returned in a full way to the Lord&rsquo;s word but also has abandoned all names other than that of the Lord Jesus Christ. The recovered church belongs to the Lord absolutely, having nothing to do with any denominations (any names). To deviate from the Lord&rsquo;s word is apostasy, and to denominate the church by taking any name other than the Lord&rsquo;s is spiritual fornication. The church, as the pure virgin espoused to Christ (<a href=2Co.htm#v11_2>2&nbsp;Cor. 11:2</a>), should have no name other than her Husband&rsquo;s. All other names are an abomination in the eyes of God. In the recovered church life there are no teachings of Balaam (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_14>2:14</a>), no teachings of the Nicolaitans (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_15>2:15</a>), no teachings of Jezebel (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_20>2:20</a>), and no mysterious doctrines of Satan (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_24>2:24</a>); there is only the pure word of the Lord. The recovered church has no denominations (names); it has only the unique name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The deviation from the word to heresies and the exalting of many names other than that of Christ are the most striking signs of degraded Christianity. The return to the pure word from all heresies and traditions and the exalting of the Lord&rsquo;s name by abandoning every other name constitute the most inspiring testimony in the recovered church. This is why the church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has the revelation and presence of the Lord and expresses the Lord in a living way, full of light and with the riches of life."

This is for Him to observe and search that He may exercise judgment by enlightening. In this book His eyes are not two but seven (<a href=Rev.htm#v5_6>5:6</a>). Seven is the number of completion in God&rsquo;s move. Hence, Christ&rsquo;s eyes in this book are for God&rsquo;s operation. These seven eyes of His are the seven lamps of fire (cf. <a href=Dan.htm#v10_6>Dan. 10:6</a>) burning before the throne, and the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God (<a href=Rev.htm#v4_5>4:5</a>). The &ldquo;fire burning&rdquo; equals the &ldquo;flame of fire&rdquo; and is for observing and searching. The seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth (<a href=Rev.htm#v5_6>5:6</a>) also are for God&rsquo;s move on the earth. Thus, the eyes of Christ in this book are the seven Spirits of God for God&rsquo;s move and operation on earth today."
