The name indicates that Haggai the prophet, who had been born in captivity in Babylon, expected earnestly to return from the captivity that the feasts of Jehovah might be restored.<br> &emsp; The central thought of Haggai&rsquo;s prophecy is that the building of the house of Jehovah is related to the welfare of God&rsquo;s people today and to the coming of the millennial kingdom with its Messiah in the age of restoration (<a href=Mat.htm#v19_28>Matt. 19:28</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v3_20>Acts 3:20</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v3_21>21</a>). In the Old Testament the house of God, or the temple, was first a type of Christ as the house of God individually (<a href=Joh.htm#v2_19>John 2:19</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v2_21>21</a>) and then a type of the church, the Body, the enlarged Christ, as God&rsquo;s house corporately (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>).
