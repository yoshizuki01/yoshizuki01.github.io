Ruth, however, not only was accepted by the Lord but also became one of the most important ancestors of Christ because she sought God and God&rsquo;s people (<a href=Rut.htm#v1_15>Ruth 1:15</a>-<a href=Rut.htm#v1_17>17</a>; <a href=Rut.htm#v2_11>2:11</a>-<a href=Rut.htm#v2_12>12</a>).

The fire in <a href=Lev.htm#v2>Lev. 2</a> signifies the consuming God (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_29>Heb. 12:29</a>), not for judgment but for acceptance.
