The second, comprising chs. <a href=Eph.htm#v4>4</a>&mdash;<a href=Eph.htm#v6>6</a>, charges us concerning the living and responsibility the church should have in the Spirit on the earth. The basic charge is that we should walk worthily of God&rsquo;s calling, which is the totality of the blessings bestowed on the church, as revealed in <a href=Eph.htm#v1_3>1:3</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_14>14</a>. In the church, under the Triune God&rsquo;s abundant blessing, the saints should walk worthily of the Father&rsquo;s selection and predestination, the Son&rsquo;s redemption, and the Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and pledging. Hence, in chs. <a href=Eph.htm#v4>4</a>&mdash;<a href=Eph.htm#v6>6</a> we see, on the one hand, the living that the church should have, and, on the other hand, the responsibility that the church should bear."

The believers participate in this heading up by being willing to be headed up in the church life, by growing in life, and by living under Christ&rsquo;s light (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_4>John 1:4</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_23>Rev. 21:23</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_25>25</a>).
