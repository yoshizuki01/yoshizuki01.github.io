BD["g)0\x97"]="<b>support</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word is made up of two words: under and to take; thus, to take up (from underneath), that is, to undertake, to sustain, to support. We, the believers, including the apostle, ought to support and undertake for the needs of the brothers who work for God in His divine truth and who take nothing from the Gentiles."
BD["e-6\x97"]="<b>this</b><br> &emsp; Verses <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_4>4</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_13>13</a> show us how we have received eternal life, which is mentioned in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_1>1:1</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_2>2</a>. Then vv. <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_14>14</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_17>17</a> tell us how we should pray in the fellowship of eternal life, which is mentioned in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_3>1:3</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_7>7</a>."
BD["e,9\x97"]="<b>this</b><br> &emsp; I.e., our abiding in the love that is God Himself (<a href=1Jo.htm#v4_16>v. 16</a>). In this the love of God is perfected in us, that is, perfectly manifested in us, that we may have boldness without fear (<a href=1Jo.htm#v4_18>v. 18</a>) in the day of judgment."
BD["a4E\x97"]="<b>consuming</b><br> &emsp; God is holy; holiness is His nature. Whatever does not correspond with His holy nature, He, as the consuming fire, will consume. If the Hebrew believers had turned aside to Judaism, which was common (unholy) in the sight of God, they would have become unholy, and the holy God as the consuming fire would consume them. God is not only righteous but also holy. To satisfy God&rsquo;s righteousness we need to be justified through the redemption of Christ. To meet the demands of His holiness we need to be sanctified, to be made holy by the heavenly, present, and living Christ. Romans stresses more the matter of justification (<a href=Rom.htm#v3_24>Rom. 3:24</a>) for God&rsquo;s righteousness (<a href=Rom.htm#v3_25>Rom. 3:25</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v3_26>26</a>), whereas Hebrews emphasizes more the matter of sanctification (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_11>2:11</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_10>10:10</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v10_14>14</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v10_29>29</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v13_12>13:12</a>) for God&rsquo;s holiness (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_14>v. 14</a>). For their sanctification, it was necessary that the Hebrew believers separate themselves from the unholy Judaism unto the holy God, who has fully expressed Himself in the Son under the new covenant; otherwise, they would have defiled themselves with their old, profane religion and would be dealt with by the holy God as the consuming fire. That would be fearsome (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_31>10:31</a>)! It is no wonder that Paul was very concerned about the fear of the Lord (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_11>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:11</a>)."
BD["e,8\x9a"]="<b>abides</b><br> &emsp; To abide in love is to live a life in which we love others habitually with the love that is God Himself, that He may be expressed in us."
BD["e+<\x97"]="<b>heart</b><br> &emsp; Actually, it is our conscience, which is a part not only of our spirit but also of our heart, that blames (condemns) us. The conscience in our heart is the representative of God&rsquo;s ruling within us. If our conscience condemns us, surely God, who is greater than His representative and knows all things, will condemn us. The consciousness of such condemnation in our conscience alerts us to the danger of breaking our fellowship with God. If we attend to this, it will be a help to our fellowship with God and will keep us abiding in the Lord."
BD["A)8\x99"]="<b>a</b><br> &emsp; A wheel within a wheel indicates that in the move of the living creatures there is the move of the Lord, i.e., that the Lord moves in their moving (cf. <a href=Jam.htm#v5_17>James 5:17</a> and <a href=JamN.htm#n5_17x1>note</a>). The inner wheel, the Lord as the hub, is the source of power for the moving of the outer wheel, the church as the rim."

BD["a2K\x97"]="<b>reward</b><br> &emsp; The reward is something in addition to eternal salvation. Eternal salvation is obtained through faith, having nothing to do with our works (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_8>Eph. 2:8</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_9>9</a>), whereas the reward is given for the work that we do after we are saved (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_8>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:8</a>, <a href=1Co.htm#v3_14>14</a>). We may not receive a reward but may suffer loss, even though we are saved, because we are void of the work that the Lord approves (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:15</a>). The reward will be given to us at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, according to our works (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_27>Matt. 16:27</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_12>Rev. 22:12</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v4_5>1&nbsp;Cor. 4:5</a>). What we receive will be decided at the judgment seat of Christ (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_10>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:10</a>) and will be enjoyed in the coming kingdom (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_21>Matt. 25:21</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v25_23>23</a>). The apostle Paul strived to gain the reward (<a href=1Co.htm#v9_24>1&nbsp;Cor. 9:24</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v9_27>27</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v3_13>Phil. 3:13</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_14>14</a>; <a href=2Ti.htm#v4_7>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:7</a>-<a href=2Ti.htm#v4_8>8</a>). Even Moses looked away to the reward (<a href=Heb.htm#v11_26>11:26</a>; see <a href=HebN.htm#n11_26x3>note 3</a> there). Here the Hebrew believers were charged not to miss the reward&mdash;the coming Sabbath rest (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_9>4:9</a>), the enjoyment of Christ and the reigning with Christ in the coming kingdom."
BD["e*?\x97"]="<b>denies</b><br> &emsp; Since the Son and the Father are one (<a href=Joh.htm#v10_30>John 10:30</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v9_6>Isa. 9:6</a>), to deny the Son is to be without the Father, and to confess the Son is to have the Father. Here to deny the Son is to deny the deity of Christ, to deny that the man Jesus is God. This is a great heresy."
