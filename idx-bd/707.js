As a result, he became heir of God&rsquo;s righteousness (cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v4_3>Rom. 4:3</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v4_9>9</a>) and a herald of righteousness (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_5>2&nbsp;Pet. 2:5</a>) as a protest against the evil generation.

Here Adam&rsquo;s deep sleep for the producing of Eve as his wife typifies Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross for the producing of the church as His counterpart (<a href=Eph.htm#v5_25>Eph. 5:25</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v5_27>27</a>). Through Christ&rsquo;s death the divine life within Him was released, and through His resurrection His released divine life was imparted into His believers for the constituting of the church (see <a href=JohN.htm#n19_34x1>note 34<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Joh.htm#v19>John 19</a>).
