Here it seems that the lover does not care whether her Beloved is with her or not, as long as she remains on the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense. However, it is not possible to experience Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection as something separate and apart from Christ. The death, resurrection, ascension, and Spirit of Christ are actually Christ Himself (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_3>Rom. 6:3</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v11_25>John 11:25</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_6>Eph. 2:6</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_9>Rom. 8:9</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_10>10</a>). If we remain in Christ, who is the Spirit in our spirit (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_16>Rom. 8:16</a>), and have Christ with us, we will be in His death, His resurrection, and His ascension. This is to experience Christ, to enjoy Christ.<br> &emsp; God in His economy does not want us to experience something of Christ. Instead, He determined that we enjoy Christ Himself in many aspects. Death, resurrection, ascension, and the Spirit are the four conditions in which Christ is enjoyed by us. To die with Christ is to enjoy Christ in His death. He is always in His sweet death for our enjoyment (<a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20a</a>). To be resurrected with Christ is to enjoy the resurrected, life-giving Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_24>John 12:24</a>). To live in ascension is to enjoy Christ in the condition of ascension (<a href=Col.htm#v3_1>Col. 3:1</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v3_3>3</a>). If we enjoy Christ in ascension, we also enjoy Him in resurrection as God&rsquo;s new creation. Ascension, God&rsquo;s new creation, and resurrection are one. Christ is not only in the conditions of His death, resurrection, and ascension but also in the condition of the life-giving Spirit. He is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit of Jesus Christ to us (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v1_19>Phil. 1:19</a>).

At regeneration we receive initial salvation (see <a href=1PeN.htm#n1_5x5>note 5<sup>5</sup></a> in <a href=1Pe.htm#v1>ch. 1</a>). Then we need to grow by feeding on Christ as the nourishing milk in the word of God, unto full salvation, unto maturity for glorification.

The full salvation of the Triune God is in three stages and comprises many items:<br> &emsp; (1) The initial stage, the stage of regeneration, which is composed of redemption, sanctification (positional&mdash;<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_2>v. 2</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v6_11>1&nbsp;Cor. 6:11</a>), justification, reconciliation, and regeneration. In this stage God justified us through the redemption of Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v3_24>Rom. 3:24</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v3_26>26</a>) and regenerated us in our spirit with His life by His Spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_3>John 3:3</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_6>6</a>). Thus we received God&rsquo;s eternal salvation (<a href=Heb.htm#v5_9>Heb. 5:9</a>) and His eternal life (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_15>John 3:15</a>) and became His children (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_12>John 1:12</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_13>13</a>), who shall not perish forever (<a href=Joh.htm#v10_28>John 10:28</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v10_29>29</a>). This initial salvation has saved us from God&rsquo;s condemnation and from eternal perdition (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_18>John 3:18</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v3_16>16</a>).<br> &emsp; (2) The progressing stage, the stage of transformation, which is composed of freedom from sin, sanctification (mainly dispositional&mdash;<a href=Rom.htm#v6_19>Rom. 6:19</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v6_22>22</a>), growth in life, transformation, building up, and maturing. In this stage God is freeing us from the dominion of indwelling sin&mdash;the law of sin and of death&mdash;by the law of the Spirit of life, through the subjective working of the effectiveness of the death of Christ in us (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_6>Rom. 6:6</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v6_7>7</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v7_16>7:16</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v7_20>20</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_2>8:2</a>); sanctifying us by His Holy Spirit (<a href=Rom.htm#v15_16>Rom. 15:16</a>), with His holy nature, through His discipline (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_10>Heb. 12:10</a>) and His judgment in His own house (<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_17>4:17</a>); causing us to grow in His life (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_6>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:6</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_7>7</a>); transforming us by renewing the inward parts of our soul by the life-giving Spirit (<a href=2Co.htm#v3_6>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:6</a>, <a href=2Co.htm#v3_17>17</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v3_18>18</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v12_2>Rom. 12:2</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v4_23>Eph. 4:23</a>) through the working of all things (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_28>Rom. 8:28</a>); building us together into a spiritual house for His dwelling (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>2:5</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>Eph. 2:22</a>); and maturing us in His life (<a href=Rev.htm#v14_15>Rev. 14:15</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n14_15x1>notes</a>) for the completion of His full salvation. In this way we are being delivered from the power of sin, the world, the flesh, self, the soul (the natural life), and individualism into maturity in the divine life for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.<br> &emsp; (3) The completing stage, the stage of glorification, which is composed of the redemption (transfiguration) of our body, conformity to the Lord, glorification, the inheritance of God&rsquo;s kingdom, participation in Christ&rsquo;s kingship, and the topmost enjoyment of the Lord. In this stage God will redeem our fallen and corrupted body (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_23>Rom. 8:23</a>) by transfiguring it into the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_21>Phil. 3:21</a>); conform us to the glorious image of His firstborn Son (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>Rom. 8:29</a>), making us wholly and absolutely like Him in our regenerated spirit, transformed soul, and transfigured body; and glorify us (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_30>Rom. 8:30</a>), immersing us in His glory (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_10>Heb. 2:10</a>) that we may enter into His heavenly kingdom (<a href=2Ti.htm#v4_18>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:18</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v1_11>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:11</a>), into which He has called us (<a href=1Th.htm#v2_12>1&nbsp;Thes. 2:12</a>), and inherit it as the topmost portion of His blessing (<a href=Jam.htm#v2_5>James 2:5</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v5_21>Gal. 5:21</a>)&mdash;even that we may reign with Christ as His co-kings, participating in His kingship over the nations (<a href=2Ti.htm#v2_12>2&nbsp;Tim. 2:12</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>Rev. 20:4</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v2_26>2:26</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v2_27>27</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v12_5>12:5</a>) and sharing His royal, kingly joy in His divine government (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_21>Matt. 25:21</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v25_23>23</a>). In this way our body will be freed from the slavery of corruption of the old creation into the freedom of the glory of God&rsquo;s new creation (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_21>Rom. 8:21</a>), and our soul will be delivered out of the realm of trials and sufferings (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_6>v. 6</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v4_12>4:12</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v3_14>3:14</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v5_9>5:9</a>) into a new realm, one that is full of glory (<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_13>4:13</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v5_10>5:10</a>), and will share in and enjoy all that the Triune God is, has, and has accomplished, attained, and obtained. This is the salvation of our souls, the salvation that is ready to be revealed to us at the last time, the grace to be brought to us at the revelation of Christ in glory (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_13>v. 13</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v16_27>Matt. 16:27</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v25_31>25:31</a>). This is the end of our faith. The power of God is able to guard us unto this that we may obtain it (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_9>v. 9</a>). We should eagerly expect such a marvelous salvation (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_23>Rom. 8:23</a>) and prepare ourselves for its splendid revelation (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_19>Rom. 8:19</a>)."
