BD["=06\x97"]="<b>Make</b><br> &emsp; As the concluding word of this poetic book, the lover of Christ prays that her Beloved would make haste to come back in the power of His resurrection (gazelle and young hart) to set up His sweet and beautiful kingdom (mountains of spices), which will fill the whole earth (<a href=Rev.htm#v11_15>Rev. 11:15</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v2_35>Dan. 2:35</a>). Such a prayer portrays the union and communion between Christ as the Bridegroom and His lovers as the bride in their bridal love, in the way that the prayer of John, a lover of Christ, as the concluding word of the Holy Scriptures, reveals God&rsquo;s eternal economy concerning Christ and the church in His divine love (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_20>Rev. 22:20</a>)."
BD["e)/\x9b"]="<b>cleanses</b><br> &emsp; The tense of this verb in Greek is present and denotes continuous action, indicating that the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanses us all the time, continuously and constantly. Cleansing here refers to the instant cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood in our conscience. Before God, the redeeming blood of the Lord has cleansed us once for all eternally (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_12>Heb. 9:12</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v9_14>14</a>), and the efficacy of that cleansing lasts forever before God, so that that cleansing need not be repeated. However, in our conscience we need the instant application of the constant cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood again and again whenever our conscience is enlightened by the divine light in our fellowship with God. This instant cleansing is typified by the purification with the water of impurity mixed with the ashes of the heifer (<a href=Num.htm#v19_2>Num. 19:2</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v19_10>10</a>)."

Christ&rsquo;s shining as the great light on God&rsquo;s people saves them from the darkness of death, releases them from bondage in darkness (<a href=Isa.htm#v9_3>v. 3</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v1_13>Col. 1:13</a>), breaks the yoke that has been upon them (<a href=Isa.htm#v9_4>v. 4</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v10_26>10:26</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v10_27>27</a>), and destroys their enemies with their armor (<a href=Isa.htm#v9_5>v. 5</a>)."

BD["e*-\x98"]="<b>love</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word denotes the love that is higher and nobler than human affection (see notes <a href=2PeN.htm#n1_7x1>7<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=2PeN.htm#n1_7x2>7<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=2Pe.htm#v1>2&nbsp;Pet. 1</a>). Only this word with its verb forms is used in this Epistle for love. Here the love of God denotes our love toward God, which is generated by His love within us. The love of God, the word of the Lord, and God Himself are all related to one another. If we keep the Lord&rsquo;s word, God&rsquo;s love has been perfected in us. It is altogether a matter of the divine life, which is God Himself. God&rsquo;s love is His inward essence, and the Lord&rsquo;s word supplies us with this divine essence, with which we love the brothers. Hence, when we keep the divine word, the divine love is perfected through the divine life, by which we live."

This is a type of the New Testament believers&rsquo; participating in the Lord&rsquo;s table in an unworthy manner (<a href=1Co.htm#v11_27>1&nbsp;Cor. 11:27</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v11_31>31</a>)."

This results in an organic union with the Triune God (<a href=Mat.htm#v28_19>Matt. 28:19</a>) and makes us one spirit with the Lord (<a href=1Co.htm#v6_17>1&nbsp;Cor. 6:17</a>)."

From this house, as His own house, God begins His governmental administration by God&rsquo;s disciplinary judgment over His own children, that He may have strong ground to judge, in His universal kingdom, those who are disobedient to His gospel and rebellious toward His government.
