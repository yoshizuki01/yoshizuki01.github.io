Whether in exaltation or in being brought low, to rejoice and praise is a virtue of practical Christian perfection."

He did this by partaking of our nature, in which the devil dwells, and then annulling it on the cross through His all-inclusive death."
BD["a/)\x97"]="<b>For</b><br> &emsp; According to the work and ministry of Christ, this book has a turn at this verse, a turn from earth to heaven. To the end of <a href=Heb.htm#v6>ch. 6</a>, what is revealed is mainly Christ&rsquo;s work on earth, typified by the priesthood of Aaron. That section is the word of foundation. From this verse, Christ&rsquo;s ministry in heaven according to the order of Melchizedek is unveiled. This section is the word of perfection, which shows us how the heavenly Christ ministers in the heavenly tabernacle. His purifying of sins is typified by the work of Aaron, while His sitting down on the right hand of the Majesty on high (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_3>1:3</a>) is according to the order of Melchizedek (<a href=Psa.htm#v110_1>Psa. 110:1</a>, <a href=Psa.htm#v110_4>4</a>). His work on the cross on earth, typified by the work of Aaron, affords us forgiveness of sins. His ministry on the throne in heaven ministers to us the overcoming of sin. His cross delivered us out of Egypt; His throne brings us into Canaan. The Hebrew believers participated in His work on the cross. Now they had to press on to enter into the enjoyment of His ministry on the throne."

BD["a.,\x97"]="<b>impossible</b><br> &emsp; Those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come have already laid the foundation, at the time they believed. If they fall away and turn back, there is no need for them to lay the foundation again (<a href=Heb.htm#v6_1>v. 1</a>); there is only the need to go on, to be brought on to perfection, to maturity. There is no need for them to repeat repentance, for it is impossible for them to renew themselves unto repentance. <a href=Heb.htm#v6_1>Verse 1</a> indicates that it is not needed; <a href=Heb.htm#v6_4>v. 4</a> says that it is not possible; and vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v6_7>7</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v6_8>8</a> show that it is not right."
