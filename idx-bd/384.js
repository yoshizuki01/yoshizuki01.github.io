BD["-/,\x97"]="<b>fled</b><br> &emsp; The secret of Israel&rsquo;s defeat at Ai was that they had lost God&rsquo;s presence and were no longer one with God. After this defeat Joshua learned the lesson of staying with the Lord before the Ark (<a href=Jos.htm#v7_6>v. 6a</a>). Eventually, the Lord came in to speak to him and to tell him what to do (vv. <a href=Jos.htm#v7_10>10</a>-<a href=Jos.htm#v7_15>15</a>). The spiritual lesson to be learned from this account is that we, the people of God, should always be one with our God, who is not only among us but also in us, making us men with God&mdash;God-men. As God-men, we should practice being one with the Lord, walking with Him, living with Him, and having our entire being with Him (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_4>Rom. 8:4</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v2_10>2&nbsp;Cor. 2:10</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v5_16>Gal. 5:16</a>, <a href=Gal.htm#v5_25>25</a>). This is the way to walk as a Christian, to fight as a child of God, and to build up the Body of Christ.

When this excellent, extraordinary woman took the lead to practice the female submission to the man, the entire country came into an excellent order, assuming the proper position before Jehovah (<a href=Jdg.htm#v4_10>v. 10</a>). Among the people there were great resolutions in heart and great searchings of heart (<a href=Jdg.htm#v5_15>5:15</a>-<a href=Jdg.htm#v5_16>16</a>), and they rose up to follow the others to fight for God&rsquo;s kingdom.

BD["R+<\x8c"]="For everyone who practices evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works be reproved."
BD["+.A\x97"]="<b>face</b><br> &emsp; The word face here signifies presence. As the One whose face shines upon us, Christ the Son is the visible presence of the invisible God (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v14_7>John 14:7</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v14_9>9</a>). God and His presence are invisible, but through His incarnation He became the shining sun (<a href=Luk.htm#v1_78>Luke 1:78</a>; cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v4_16>Matt. 4:16</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v8_12>John 8:12</a>).

To believe Him is to believe that He is true and real, but to believe into Him is to receive Him and be united with Him as one. The former is to acknowledge a fact objectively; the latter is to receive a life subjectively."
BD["R)B\x8c"]="John answered them, saying, I baptize in water; <I>but</I> among you stands One whom you do not know,"

BD["T)+\x9b"]="<b>flesh</b><br> &emsp; In the Bible flesh is not a positive word. Nevertheless, the Bible declares that the Word became flesh (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>). The gospel of God concerns God who became flesh; according to the flesh He became the seed of a man (see <a href=RomN.htm#n8_3x3>note 3<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Rom.htm#v8>ch. 8</a>)."

Actually, Christ Himself is the commandment of God. We need to receive Him, keep Him, and be right with Him. If we do this, we will be right with God, and He will love us and bless us (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_21>John 14:21</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v14_23>23</a>)."
