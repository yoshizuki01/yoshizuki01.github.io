But Assyria, overstretching the limitation set by God, did not think of the matter in this way, nor did their heart conceive it in this way (<a href=Isa.htm#v10_7>v. 7</a>). Thus, Assyria acted excessively, and the king of Assyria became haughty (vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v10_12>12</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v10_15>15</a>). Jehovah, therefore, judged the king of Assyria (vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v10_16>16</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v10_19>19</a>).

These two judgments were actually one (<a href=Isa.htm#v10_22>10:22</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v10_23>23</a>). After the time of Solomon, the nation of Israel was divided into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah (<a href=1Ki.htm#v11_26>1&nbsp;Kings 11:26</a>&mdash;<a href=1Ki.htm#v12_20>12:20</a>). Because the kingdom of Israel had fallen to the extent that it was on the level of the Gentile nations, even becoming an ally to the king of Aram (<a href=Isa.htm#v7_1>7:1</a>), Israel was not only under God&rsquo;s chastisement but also under His judgment. God&rsquo;s chastisement on Israel (Ephraim&mdash;<a href=Isa.htm#v9_9>v. 9</a>) became His judgment on Israel."
