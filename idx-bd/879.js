This indicates that Isaac did not have much maturity in life. However, Isaac did bless his sons by faith, and God honored his blessing and it became a prophecy (<a href=Heb.htm#v11_20>Heb. 11:20</a>).<br> &emsp; Esau&rsquo;s despising of the birthright (<a href=Gen.htm#v25_34>25:34</a>), Rebekah&rsquo;s ingeniousness in her preferential love, and Isaac&rsquo;s blindness in blessing worked together for Jacob&rsquo;s good, that God might sovereignly fulfill the purpose of His selection (cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v8_28>Rom. 8:28</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_30>30</a>)."

This indicates also that the sonship of God is realized by us through our subjective experience in the depth of our being.
