It means the reality, denoting all the real things revealed in God&rsquo;s word, which are mainly Christ as the reality of all the things of God. The manifestation of the truth refers to the apostles&rsquo; living of Christ. When they lived Christ, who is the truth (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_6>John 14:6</a>), they manifested the truth. As Christ was lived out of them, the truth was manifested in them. By this, they commended themselves to every conscience of men before God. The apostles behaved themselves not in the way of adulterating the word of God but in the way of manifesting the truth for the shining of the gospel of the glory of Christ, by the excellent power of the priceless treasure, the very Christ who entered into them and became their content (<a href=2Co.htm#v4_7>v. 7</a>) through the enlightenment of God&rsquo;s shining (<a href=2Co.htm#v4_6>v. 6</a>)."

In <a href=Exo.htm#v17>Exo. 17</a> Moses struck the rock with his rod, and water flowed out for the people to drink (see notes <a href=ExoN.htm#n17_6x2>6<sup>2</sup></a> and <a href=ExoN.htm#n17_6x3>6<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v17>Exo. 17</a>). According to Paul&rsquo;s word in <a href=1Co.htm#v10_4>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:4</a> (see <a href=1CoN.htm#n10_4x2>note 4<sup>2</sup></a> there), this rock was a spiritual rock that followed God&rsquo;s people in their journey through the wilderness. This signifies that Christ has been crucified to become a rock that follows His people. This following rock is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>), who is always with the church to supply His believers with the water of life.<br> &emsp; Since Christ has been crucified and the Spirit has been given, there is no need for Christ to be crucified again, i.e., no need to strike the rock again, that the living water may flow. In God&rsquo;s economy Christ should be crucified only once (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_27>Heb. 7:27</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v9_26>9:26</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v9_28>28a</a>). To receive the living water from the crucified Christ, we need only to &ldquo;take the rod&rdquo; and &ldquo;speak to the rock.&rdquo; To take the rod is to identify with Christ in His death and apply the death of Christ to ourselves and our situation. To speak to the rock is to speak a direct word to Christ as the smitten rock, asking Him to give us the Spirit of life (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v4_10>John 4:10</a>) based on the fact that the Spirit has already been given. If we apply the death of Christ to ourselves and ask Christ in faith to give us the Spirit, we will receive the living Spirit as the bountiful supply of life (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_19>Phil. 1:19</a>)."

BD["0,3\x97"]="<b>taken</b><br> &emsp; At this point the Ark was separated from the tabernacle. This abnormal situation persisted for many years, until a full recovery was realized by the people of Israel. In the first stage of its history, the Ark was in the tabernacle (<a href=Exo.htm#v40_21>Exo. 40:21</a>); this is the normal situation. Then, due to Israel&rsquo;s degradation, the Ark was captured by the Philistines and was separated from the tabernacle (<a href=1Sa.htm#v4_11>4:11</a>&mdash;<a href=1Sa.htm#v6_1>6:1</a>), leaving the tabernacle an empty vessel without the proper content. Later, the Ark was recovered and brought first to the house of Abinadab at Kiriath-jearim, where it remained for twenty years (<a href=1Sa.htm#v6_2>6:2</a>&mdash;<a href=1Sa.htm#v7_2>7:2</a>), and then to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite, where it stayed for three months (<a href=2Sa.htm#v6_1>2&nbsp;Sam. 6:1</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v6_11>11</a>). Still, the Ark was apart from the tabernacle, which was at Shiloh (<a href=1Sa.htm#v1_24>1:24</a>; <a href=Jos.htm#v18_1>Josh. 18:1</a>). David moved the Ark from Obed-edom&rsquo;s house to a tent that he had prepared for it in his own city, at Mount Zion, the choicest place in Jerusalem (<a href=2Sa.htm#v6_12>2&nbsp;Sam. 6:12</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v6_19>19</a>; <a href=1Ch.htm#v15_1>1&nbsp;Chron. 15:1</a>&mdash;<a href=1Ch.htm#v16_1>16:1</a>). This was an improved situation, but the Ark was still in an improper place; it had not been returned to the tabernacle. Finally, after Solomon finished the building of the temple in Jerusalem, the Ark was moved into the Holy of Holies in the temple (<a href=1Ki.htm#v8_1>1&nbsp;Kings 8:1</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v8_11>11</a>). This was a full recovery of the normal situation.<br> &emsp; The history of the Ark and the tabernacle prefigures the history of the church. In the first stage of its history, the church was the expression of Christ, and Christ was the content of the church. This is the normal condition. However, in the second stage the church became degraded and lost the reality and presence of Christ (cf. <a href=Rev.htm#v3_20>Rev. 3:20</a>). It became an empty vessel, an outward expression without the inward reality. After this, beginning from the second century a number of &ldquo;Obed-edoms&rdquo; were raised up, who had the Lord&rsquo;s presence (the Ark) but did not have the proper church life as the expression of Christ (the tabernacle). Later, other believers who, like David, cared for God&rsquo;s interests attempted to practice the church life according to their own choice, not according to God&rsquo;s revelation. These believers had Christ, but they had Him with an improper practice of the church life (David&rsquo;s tent in Jerusalem). Today in His recovery the Lord is working to restore the normal condition of Christ within the proper church as His expression."

BD[")D*\x97"]="<b>garments</b><br> &emsp; In typology garments signify expression (cf. <a href=Isa.htm#v64_6>Isa. 64:6</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v19_8>Rev. 19:8</a>). The priestly garments signify the serving priests&rsquo; expression of Christ. The priests were also sanctified, separated to God, by their holy garments (<a href=Exo.htm#v28_3>v. 3</a>)."
BD[")C-\x97"]="<b>ledge</b><br> &emsp; The ledge, located inside the altar, might have strengthened the grating and protected the acacia wood in the walls of the altar from the heat of the fire that burned continually on the grating. Thus, the ledge may signify the strengthening power that upheld Christ while He suffered the burning of God&rsquo;s righteous judgment on the cross, and also the protection that enabled Christ in His humanity (signified by the acacia wood) to bear the judgment of God."
BD["T.6\x98"]="<b>for</b><br> &emsp; That we are not under the law but under grace is the reason sin cannot lord it over us. This gives us the position to reject sin. Sin no longer has any right to make claims upon us, but we have the full right to reject sin and its power. By rejecting sin and taking sides with the resurrected Christ, we present ourselves and our members as slaves to righteousness that the divine life may work within us to sanctify us, not only positionally but also dispositionally, with the holy nature of God."
BD["O:?\x98"]="<b>settle</b><br> &emsp; This refers to the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_10>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:10</a>)."
BD["T-9\x98"]="<b>righteousness</b><br> &emsp; The gift of righteousness erases judgment. Judgment comes from sin, but righteousness comes from grace. Righteousness always accompanies grace and is its result. Subjective righteousness (<a href=Rom.htm#v4_25>4:25b</a>) comes from grace (vv. <a href=Rom.htm#v5_17>17</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v5_19>19</a>), and grace comes from objective righteousness (vv. <a href=Rom.htm#v5_1>1</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v5_2>2</a>)."
BD[")A3\x97"]="<b>gold</b><br> &emsp; The Ark was made of acacia wood (<a href=Exo.htm#v25_10>v. 10</a>) overlaid with gold, signifying that Christ is one person with two natures, the human nature and the divine nature. He is both God and man&mdash;a God-man. That the acacia wood was overlaid with gold both inside and outside signifies the divine nature mingled with the human nature&mdash;God and man becoming one&mdash;without a third nature being produced by the mingling. It also signifies that the divine nature penetrates the human nature and rests on the human nature so that it may be expressed through the human nature."

BD[")<B\x97"]="<b>steps</b><br> &emsp; Steps refer to man&rsquo;s way, which promotes achievement by natural ability and creates different levels of attainment among God&rsquo;s people. The altar (cross) prepared by God is not elevated but is close to the ground, eliminating the need for steps and making it possible for anyone to approach it."
