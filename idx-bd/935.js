BD["c)3\x99"]="<b>of</b><br> &emsp; The highly respected Vaticanus MS omits, of Christ. This omission fits into the New Testament revelation concerning the Spirit. However, the other authoritative MSS have of Christ in their text. In the New Testament revelation the Spirit of Christ denotes the Spirit after Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_9>Rom. 8:9</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_11>11</a>). Before Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, the Spirit who is not only the Spirit of God but the Spirit of Christ was not yet (<a href=Joh.htm#v7_39>John 7:39</a>). The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God constituted through and with the death and resurrection of Christ for the application and impartation of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection to His believers. Although the constituting of the Spirit of Christ is dispensational&mdash;i.e., the Spirit of Christ was constituted dispensationally through and with Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection in the New Testament time&mdash;the function of the Spirit of Christ is eternal, because He is the eternal Spirit (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_14>Heb. 9:14</a>). This is like the cross of Christ: as an event, it was accomplished at the time of Christ&rsquo;s death, yet its function is eternal; hence, in the eternal sight of God, Christ was slain from the foundation of the world (<a href=Rev.htm#v13_8>Rev. 13:8</a>). In Old Testament times the Spirit of God, as the Spirit of Christ, made the time and the manner of time concerning Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection clear to the prophets who were seeking and searching diligently concerning the sufferings and glories of Christ."

BD[">,*\x98"]="<b>Shoot</b><br> &emsp; In this book Christ is unveiled as the God-man. The Shoot of Jehovah refers to Christ&rsquo;s deity, showing His divine nature, and the fruit of the earth (<a href=Luk.htm#v1_42>Luke 1:42</a>) refers to Christ&rsquo;s humanity with His human nature. As the Shoot of Jehovah, Christ comes out of God, out of eternity (<a href=Joh.htm#v8_42>John 8:42</a>; <a href=Mic.htm#v5_2>Micah 5:2</a>). As the fruit of the earth, Christ, having a human body made of dust (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_7>Gen. 2:7</a>), grows out of the earth (cf. <a href=Isa.htm#v53_2>53:2</a>). In the restoration, to those of Israel who have escaped, Christ in His deity will be beauty and glory, and in His humanity, which expresses His divine beauty and glory, He will be excellence and splendor. The Shoot of Jehovah denotes that through His incarnation Christ is a new development of Jehovah God for the Triune God to branch Himself out in His divinity into humanity (<a href=Isa.htm#v7_14>7:14</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v1_22>Matt. 1:22</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v1_23>23</a>). This is for Jehovah God&rsquo;s increase and spread in the universe. The fruit of the earth denotes that Christ, as the divine Shoot of Jehovah, also becomes a man of flesh from the earth (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v2_14>Heb. 2:14</a>). This is for the Triune God to be multiplied and reproduced in humanity. As a man with the divine life, He is a seed, a grain of wheat, to produce many grains, His believers as His many brothers, through His death and resurrection (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_24>John 12:24</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v20_17>20:17</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>Rom. 8:29</a>).<br> &emsp; The Shoot of Jehovah denotes the riches, the refreshing, the vigor, the growth, and the productive power of the divine life. The fruit of the earth denotes the produce brought forth, carried out, and expressed in Christ&rsquo;s humanity. As seen in the four Gospels, all the fruit born by Christ came out of the divine life, but it was produced in Christ&rsquo;s humanity. In Christ, the God-man, God and man live together as one, with God as the life inwardly and man as the fruit outwardly."
