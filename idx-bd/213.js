Thus, Abel&rsquo;s tending of sheep was not to produce food for his living but to provide offerings for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. Abel not only believed the gospel (see <a href=GenN.htm#n4_4x1>note 4<sup>1</sup></a>) but also practiced the gospel and lived for it."

BD["(*/\x9b"]="<b>breath</b><br> &emsp; Heb. neshamah, translated spirit in <a href=Prv.htm#v20_27>Prov. 20:27</a>, indicating that the breath of life breathed into man&rsquo;s body became the spirit of man, the human spirit (cf. <a href=Job.htm#v32_8>Job 32:8</a>). Man&rsquo;s spirit is his inward organ for him to contact God, receive God, contain God, and assimilate God into his entire being as his life and his everything. It was specifically formed by God and is ranked in importance with the heavens and the earth in God&rsquo;s holy Word (<a href=Zec.htm#v12_1>Zech. 12:1</a>). The spirit of man is for man to worship God (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_24>John 4:24</a>), to be regenerated by God (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_6>John 3:6b</a>), and to be joined to God (<a href=1Co.htm#v6_17>1&nbsp;Cor. 6:17</a>; <a href=2Ti.htm#v4_22>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:22</a>) that man may walk and live in an organic union with God (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_4>Rom. 8:4b</a>) to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose.<br> &emsp; The breath of life breathed into man&rsquo;s nostrils was not the eternal life of God nor the Spirit of God. See <a href=LukN.htm#n3_38x2>note 38<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Luk.htm#v3>Luke 3</a>. Man did not receive the Spirit of God until the Lord breathed the Holy Spirit into His disciples on the day of His resurrection (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_22>John 20:22</a>). Nevertheless, because the human spirit came out of God&rsquo;s breath of life, it is very close to the Spirit of God. Thus, there can be a transmission between God the Spirit and man&rsquo;s spirit, and the human spirit is able to contact God and be one with God (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_16>Rom. 8:16</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n8_16x2>note 2</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v6_17>1&nbsp;Cor. 6:17</a> and <a href=1CoN.htm#n6_17x2>note 2</a>).<br> &emsp; Within man&rsquo;s spirit there are three functions: conscience, enabling man to know what God justifies and what He condemns (<a href=Rom.htm#v9_1>Rom. 9:1</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n9_1x2>note 2</a>); fellowship, that man may contact God, worship God, and commune with God (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_24>John 4:24</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v6_18>Eph. 6:18a</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v1_9>Rom. 1:9</a>); and intuition, giving man a direct sense of God and a direct knowledge from God (<a href=Mrk.htm#v2_8>Mark 2:8</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v2_11>1&nbsp;Cor. 2:11</a>)."
