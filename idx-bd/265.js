BD[">PG\x97"]="<b>wait</b><br> &emsp; To wait on the eternal God (<a href=Isa.htm#v40_28>v. 28</a>) means that we terminate ourselves, i.e., that we stop ourselves with our living, our doing, and our activity, and receive God in Christ as our life, our person, and our replacement. Such a waiting one will be renewed and strengthened to such an extent that he will mount up with wings like eagles. He will not only walk and run but also soar in the heavens, far above every earthly frustration. This is a transformed person. This chapter leads us to a comparison between Hezekiah, a godly man who was still in the old creation (chs. <a href=Isa.htm#v36>36</a>&mdash;<a href=Isa.htm#v39>39</a>), and a regenerated and transformed person in the new creation.<br> &emsp; In <a href=Isa.htm#v40>Isa. 40</a> there are the announcing of the gospel (corresponding to the four Gospels&mdash;vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v40_1>1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v40_5>5</a>), salvation through regeneration (corresponding to the Acts&mdash;vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v40_6>6</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v40_8>8</a>), and transformation (corresponding to the Epistles&mdash;vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v40_28>28</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v40_31>31</a>)."

BD["(*1\x99"]="<b>tree</b><br> &emsp; The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of death to man (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_14>Heb. 2:14</a>). It also signifies all things apart from God, for anything that is not God Himself, including good things and even scriptural things and religious things, can be utilized by Satan, the subtle one, to bring death to man. Even the Scriptures inspired by God and the law given by God can be utilized by Satan as the tree of knowledge to bring in death (<a href=Joh.htm#v5_39>John 5:39</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v5_40>40</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_6>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:6b</a>).<br> &emsp; The tree of life causes man to be dependent on God (<a href=Joh.htm#v15_5>John 15:5</a>), whereas the tree of knowledge causes man to rebel against God and to be independent from Him (cf. <a href=Gen.htm#v3_5>3:5</a>). The two trees issue in two lines&mdash;the line of life and the line of death&mdash;that run through the entire Bible and end in the book of Revelation. Death begins with the tree of knowledge (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_17>v. 17</a>) and ends with the lake of fire (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_10>Rev. 20:10</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_14>14</a>). Life begins with the tree of life and ends in the New Jerusalem, the city of the water of life (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>Rev. 22:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v22_2>2</a>)."
