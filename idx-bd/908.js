BD[":/+\x97"]="<b>unrighteousness</b><br> &emsp; In this psalm David felt that he had done no wrong, and he asked God to judge him according to his righteousness and his integrity (<a href=Psa.htm#v7_8>v. 8</a>). This shows that David had not been enlightened and convicted by God concerning his own sinfulness (cf. <a href=Psa.htm#v51>Psa. 51</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v64_6>Isa. 64:6</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v7_18>Rom. 7:18</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v18_9>Luke 18:9</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v18_14>14</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v1_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 1:15</a>).<br> &emsp; Like the book of Job, many of the psalms give us the impression that we need to be godly, to fear God and trust in Him, to keep the law, to maintain our integrity, and to be righteous, upright, just, and perfect (cf. <a href=JobN.htm#n1_1x4P1>note 1<sup>4</sup>, par. 1</a>, in <a href=Job.htm#v1>Job 1</a>). Such a concept, however, is not according to the divine revelation of the New Testament; it is altogether the concept of the Old Testament under the law according to the knowledge of good and evil. The New Testament reveals that we have been crucified with Christ (<a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20</a>) and buried with Him (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_4>Rom. 6:4</a>). Death has liberated us from the law (<a href=Rom.htm#v7_1>Rom. 7:1</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v7_6>6</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v2_19>Gal. 2:19</a>). Now we should simply receive Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, and let Him live in us, no longer caring for our righteousness, justice, or integrity but caring only for Christ, the living One (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_6>Phil. 3:6b</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_9>9</a>)."

BD["a)+\x98"]="<b>word</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word denotes the instant word. The Son upholds and bears all things not by His work but by His instant word, the word of His power. In creation all things came into being through Him as the Word (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>John 1:1</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_3>3</a>). The universe has been framed by the word of God (<a href=Heb.htm#v11_3>11:3</a>): &ldquo;He spoke, and it was; He commanded, and it stood&rdquo; (<a href=Psa.htm#v33_9>Psa. 33:9</a>). In salvation we are saved through His word (<a href=Joh.htm#v5_24>John 5:24</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v10_8>Rom. 10:8</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v10_17>17</a>). It is through His word that His authority with power is exercised (<a href=Mat.htm#v8_8>Matt. 8:8</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v8_9>9</a>). It is by His word that His healing power is realized (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_50>John 4:50</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v4_51>51</a>). Here, this book says that God speaks in the Son and the Son upholds and bears all things by His word. It is altogether a matter of speaking. When the Lord speaks, everything is in order."
