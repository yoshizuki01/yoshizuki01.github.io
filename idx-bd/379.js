BD["i+6\x98"]="<b>Amen</b><br> &emsp; In addressing each of the seven churches, the Lord referred to what He is and what He does, respectively, according to the situation and condition of each. Here, in addressing the church in Laodicea, He referred to Himself as &ldquo;the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God.&rdquo; Amen, from Hebrew, means firm, steadfast, or trustworthy. The Lord is the firm, steadfast, and trustworthy One. Hence, He is the faithful and true Witness. This indicates that the degraded church in Laodicea is not firm, steadfast, trustworthy, or faithful and true as the Lord&rsquo;s witness. The beginning of the creation of God refers to the Lord as the origin or source of God&rsquo;s creation, implying that the Lord is the unchanging and ever-existing source of God&rsquo;s work. This indicates that the degraded recovered church has changed by leaving the Lord as the source."
BD["B,E\x97"]="<b>twelve</b><br> &emsp; God gave Nebuchadnezzar twelve months to repent. However, Nebuchadnezzar was void of the capacity to know God inwardly, and nothing within him was touched. Hence, there was no repentance and no change; rather, Nebuchadnezzar was filled with pride (vv. <a href=Dan.htm#v4_30>30</a>, <a href=Dan.htm#v4_37>37</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v5_20>5:20</a>) and thus came under God&rsquo;s judgment (<a href=Prv.htm#v16_18>Prov. 16:18</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v5_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 5:5</a>)."
BD["i*9\x98"]="<b>hidden</b><br> &emsp; Manna is a type of Christ as the heavenly food that enables God&rsquo;s people to go His way.

The open manna was for the Lord&rsquo;s people to enjoy in a public way; the hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for His overcoming seekers, who overcome the degradation of the worldly church. While the church goes the way of the world, these overcomers come forward to abide in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply. This promise is being fulfilled today in the proper church life and will be fulfilled in full in the coming kingdom. If we seek the Lord, overcome the degradation of the worldly church, and enjoy a special portion of the Lord today, He as the hidden manna will be a reward to us in the coming kingdom. If we miss Him as our special portion today in the church life, we will surely lose the enjoyment of Him as a reward in the coming kingdom."

He told Daniel that for twenty-one days he himself had been fighting against the prince of the kingdom of Persia (<a href=Dan.htm#v10_13>v. 13</a>, cf. <a href=Dan.htm#v10_20>v. 20a</a>), probably an evil spirit, a rebellious angel, who followed Satan in his rebellion against God (<a href=Rev.htm#v12_4>Rev. 12:4a</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v12_9>9b</a>) and who was commissioned by Satan to help Persia. Thus, while Daniel was praying during those days, a spiritual struggle was taking place in the air between two spirits, one belonging to Satan and the other belonging to God. Another evil spirit, the prince of Greece (Javan), was about to come (<a href=Dan.htm#v10_20>v. 20b</a>). Only the archangel Michael, a prince fighting for Israel, fought together with the angelic messenger against the evil spirits (vv. <a href=Dan.htm#v10_13>13</a>, <a href=Dan.htm#v10_21>21</a>; cf. <a href=Jud.htm#v9>Jude 9</a>).

All this indicates that behind the physical scene a spiritual struggle, an invisible spiritual war, was taking place (cf. <a href=Eph.htm#v6_10>Eph. 6:10</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v6_20>20</a>).
