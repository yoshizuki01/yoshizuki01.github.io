The implication of the context is that the staggering Hebrew believers should abandon all appearance of the practices of Judaism (i.e., make straight paths) that they, the lame members (limbs) of the Body, might not fall into apostasy (i.e., not be put out of joint) but rather be brought fully into the new covenant way (i.e., be healed)."

The Assyrians came to invade Judah and to oppress them, but the Lord destroyed them as He had destroyed the Midianites through Gideon (<a href=2Ki.htm#v19_35>2&nbsp;Kings 19:35</a>-<a href=2Ki.htm#v19_37>37</a>)."

This indicates that (1) this age is a dark place in the dark night (<a href=Rom.htm#v13_12>Rom. 13:12</a>), and all the people of this world are moving and acting in darkness; and (2) the prophetic word of the Scripture, as the shining lamp to the believers, conveys spiritual light that shines in their darkness (not merely knowledge in letters for their mental apprehension), guiding them to enter into a bright day, even to pass through the dark night until the day of the Lord&rsquo;s appearing dawns. Before the Lord as the sunlight appears, we need this word as light to shine over our footsteps."

This does not denote being without the Mosaic law (cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v5_13>Rom. 5:13</a>), because sin was already in the world before the Mosaic law was given. To be without law here denotes being without, or not under, the principle of God&rsquo;s ruling over man. To practice lawlessness is to live a life outside of and not under the principle of God&rsquo;s ruling over man. Hence, lawlessness is sin, or, reciprocally, sin is lawlessness."

This age signifies maturity, indicating that in spiritual things, especially in seeing the visions recorded in this book, there is the need of maturity in the divine life (cf. <a href=1Co.htm#v2_14>1&nbsp;Cor. 2:14</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v2_15>15</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_2>2</a>)."

It is synonymous with truth in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_8>v. 8</a>. In this word God exposes our true condition, which is sinful both before and after regeneration.

The most preferred is as follows: it refers to a Christian sister of some prominence in the church, as does co-chosen in <a href=1Pe.htm#v5_13>1&nbsp;Pet. 5:13</a>. Kuria might have been her name, since it was a common name at that time. Some mention that according to history she lived near Ephesus and that her sister (<a href=2Jo.htm#v13>v. 13</a>) lived in Ephesus, where the church was under John&rsquo;s care. There was a church in her locality, and it met in her home."
