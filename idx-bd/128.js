BD[":))\x97"]="<b>Blessed</b><br> &emsp; Or, Happy. Psalms is not a book of doctrines or of any kind of teaching. It is a book of divine revelation composed of the expressions, sentiments, feelings, impressions, and experiences of godly men concerning (1) God and the way He is in His dealing with them; (2) the law of God as the holy Word with the divine revelation; (3) the house of God, the temple, and Mount Zion, on which the temple was seated, as the center of God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth; (4) the holy city of God, Jerusalem, as the encompassing protection of the house of God; (5) the holy people of God, Israel, as God&rsquo;s beloved elect among the nations; (6) Israel&rsquo;s love toward God, their fellowship with God, their blessings received of God, their sufferings under God&rsquo;s dealings, and their environment; (7) their captivity; and (8) their thanksgivings and praises to Jehovah their God, whom they tasted and enjoyed. Through the godly expressions of the psalmists Christ is revealed and the church as God&rsquo;s house and God&rsquo;s city is typified.<br> &emsp; The Psalms were written according to two kinds of concepts: the human concept of the holy writers and the divine concept of God. The human concept of the holy writers was produced out of their good nature created by God, formed with the traditions of their holy race, constituted with the teachings of the Holy Scriptures, promoted by their practice of a holy life, and uttered out of their holy sentiments and impressions. The divine concept of God as the divine revelation in the Psalms concerns three major items: (1) God&rsquo;s eternal economy, of which Christ is the centrality and universality; (2) Christ in His divinity, humanity, human living, all-inclusive death, life-imparting and church-producing resurrection, glorification, ascension, appearing in glory, and reigning forever; and (3) God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, His good pleasure, in Christ as His centrality and universality, in the church as His fullness for His expression, in the kingdom for His eternal administration, and in the recovery of the earth for His eternal kingdom in eternity. In the Psalms only what is written out of the divine concept of God, and not what is written out of the human concept of the psalmists, should be considered as part of the divine revelation from God concerning His divine economy.<br> &emsp; According to the divine concept, the central thought of the book of Psalms is Christ, as revealed in plain words (<a href=Luk.htm#v24_44>Luke 24:44</a>), and the church as the house of God and the city of God for His kingdom, as typified by the temple and by the city of Jerusalem. The spirit, the reality, the characteristic, of the divine revelation in the book of Psalms is Christ as the centrality and universality of the eternal economy of God. For this, Christ is first the embodiment of the Triune God (<a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>), then the house, the habitation, of God (signified by the temple&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v2_19>John 2:19</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v2_21>21</a>), the kingdom of God (signified by the city of Jerusalem&mdash;<a href=Luk.htm#v17_21>Luke 17:21</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_3>Rev. 22:3b</a>), and the Ruler of the entire earth from the house of God and in the kingdom of God (<a href=Dan.htm#v2_34>Dan. 2:34</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v2_35>35</a>). Thus, He is all in all in the entire universe (cf. <a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>Eph. 1:23</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v3_11>Col. 3:11</a>). Such a divine revelation is the same as what is revealed in the entire Holy Scriptures. The only particular point related to the divine revelation in the book of Psalms is that such a high revelation, even the highest peak of the divine revelation, is prophesied in the expressions of the sentiments of the ancient godly saints. Thus, it is mixed with their comfort in sufferings and with the cultivation of godliness. The consummation of this highest divine revelation is the city of New Jerusalem as a sign of the habitation, the tabernacle, of God (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_1>Rev. 21:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>3</a>), through which the processed and consummated Triune God will be manifested and expressed in the all-inclusive Christ and will reign on the new earth in the new universe for eternity."
BD["^)2\x98"]="<b>nullified</b><br> &emsp; Christ nullified death, making it of none effect, through His devil-destroying death (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_14>Heb. 2:14</a>) and death-swallowing resurrection (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_52>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:52</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v15_54>54</a>)."
BD["[-?\x9e"]="<b>coming</b><br> &emsp; Every chapter of this book ends with the coming of the Lord. This shows that the writer, Paul, lived and worked with the Lord&rsquo;s coming before him, taking it as an attraction, an incentive, a goal, and a warning.

BD["23S\x97"]="<b>slept</b><br> &emsp; Solomon&rsquo;s decease (vv. <a href=1Ki.htm#v11_41>41</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v11_43>43</a>) was in gloomy disappointment. His glory fell off like the flower of grass (<a href=Mat.htm#v6_29>Matt. 6:29</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_24>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:24</a>), and his splendid career became &ldquo;vanity of vanities,&rdquo; as he had preached (<a href=Ecc.htm#v1_2>Eccl. 1:2</a>). However, what God did through him as a type of Christ remains forever (see <a href=1KiN.htm#n2_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=1Ki.htm#v2>ch. 2</a>).<br> &emsp; Under the light of the spiritual life, it is clear that Solomon was a wise man but not a spiritual man; a man of capability, not a man of life; a man whose wisdom was a gift, not a measure of life. The careers he accomplished were evidences of his capacity from his God-given gift of wisdom, not manifestations of the ability of the maturity of the divine life. Capability apart from life is like a snake, poisoning God&rsquo;s people; life is like a dove, supplying God&rsquo;s people with life. Cf. <a href=RutN.htm#n4_18x1>note 18<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Rut.htm#v4>Ruth 4</a>.<br> &emsp; Solomon&rsquo;s enjoyment of the God-given good land reached the highest level through his God-given gift. However, because of his small measure in the maturity of the spiritual life, he was cut off from the enjoyment of the good land in God&rsquo;s economy because of his unbridled indulgence of his lust. His father David, a man according to God&rsquo;s heart, failed in this same gross and ugly sin (<a href=2Sa.htm#v11>2&nbsp;Sam. 11</a>). Solomon&rsquo;s failure in this satanic temptation was much greater than his father&rsquo;s. This caused his descendants to lose more than ninety percent of their kingdom and caused the people of God&rsquo;s elect to suffer division and confusion among themselves throughout many generations. Eventually, they lost the God-given land and became captives in the foreign lands of idol worship. The nation of Israel is still suffering because of Solomon&rsquo;s failure. What a warning and an alarm this should be to us! We must be careful. Even a little failure in the indulgence of lust can damage the church and kill the splendid aspects of the church life."

According to <a href=Deu.htm#v33_20>Deut. 33:20</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v33_21>21</a>, Gad was enlarged because of his victory; he provided the first part of the good land (the land east of the Jordan) for himself, but before enjoying his portion, he went with his brothers and fought with them to gain their portion of the land west of the Jordan (<a href=Num.htm#v32_1>Num. 32:1</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v32_32>32</a>), thus executing Jehovah&rsquo;s righteousness and His judgments in Israel.
