BD["a52\x97"]="<b>altar</b><br> &emsp; This altar must be the cross on which the Lord Jesus offered Himself as the sacrifice for our sins (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_12>10:12</a>). According to the regulations concerning the offerings in the Old Testament, the sacrifice for sin, or the sin offering, the blood of which was brought into the Holy of Holies or the Holy Place to make expiation, afforded the offering priest or the offerer nothing to eat; the entire offering had to be burned up (<a href=Lev.htm#v4_2>Lev. 4:2</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v4_12>12</a>; <a href=Lev.htm#v16_27>16:27</a>; <a href=Lev.htm#v6_30>6:30</a>). Hence, those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat from the altar of the sin offering (which in the New Testament fulfillment is the Lord&rsquo;s cross). <a href=Heb.htm#v13_10>Verse 10</a> is a strong argument against the Judaizers&rsquo; using of food in their strange teachings to attempt to carry away the new covenant believers from the enjoyment of Christ. The Judaizers&rsquo; emphasis was on the food that they enjoyed in their religious services. But the writer of this book argued that in the sin offering, the basic offering for yearly expiation (<a href=Lev.htm#v16>Lev. 16</a>), there was nothing for anyone to eat. With the sin offering, it is not a matter of eating it but a matter of receiving its efficacy. Now the real sin offering is Christ, who offered Himself to God for our sin and accomplished full redemption (better than expiation&mdash;see <a href=HebN.htm#n9_12x2>note 12<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v9>ch. 9</a>) for us that we may be brought into the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s grace in Him under the new covenant. What we need today is not to eat the food of the old covenant services but to receive the efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s offering and follow Him in the new covenant grace outside the camp, outside the Jewish religion."

A similar warning was given in <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_18>2:18</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_23>23</a>. The expressions every spirit and the spirits refer to the spirits of the prophets (<a href=1Co.htm#v14_32>1&nbsp;Cor. 14:32</a>), which are motivated by the Spirit of truth, and the spirits of the false prophets, which are actuated by the spirit of deception.

BD["a45\x97"]="<b>paths</b><br> &emsp; The Christian life is not a matter of theoretical doctrines for the mind to think about. It must consist of practical paths for our feet to walk on. All the sound, healthy doctrines in the Bible are paths that can be walked on. This is especially true with the book of Hebrews. First, this book ministers to us the highest and healthiest doctrines concerning Christ and His new covenant. Then, based on the proper doctrines that it shows us, it charges us to run the race and make straight paths for our feet. The first section of this book (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_1>1:1</a>&mdash;<a href=Heb.htm#v10_18>10:18</a>) deals with doctrines, and the second (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_19>10:19</a>&mdash;<a href=Heb.htm#v13_25>13:25</a>) deals with the race and the paths."
BD["c+=\x9a"]="<b>appeal</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word denotes a question, an inquiry. Its meaning is very much disputed. The right meaning seems to be as indicated by Alford&mdash;&ldquo;the seeking after God in a good and pure conscience.&rdquo; It is this that governs the proper Christian life. This kind of question, which asks for something, can be considered an appeal or demand. Peter&rsquo;s thought here may be that baptism is the baptized one&rsquo;s appeal to God for a good conscience toward God. Baptism, as a symbol, a counterpart of our belief in all the accomplishments of Christ, testifies that all the problems we have before God and with God have been solved. Hence, it is also a testimony, witnessing that in our conscience there is no more accusation and that instead we are full of peace and are confident that we have been baptized into the Triune God (<a href=Mat.htm#v28_19>Matt. 28:19</a>) and have been organically united with Him through the resurrection of Christ, that is, by Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of life. Without the Spirit of Christ as its reality, baptism by water immediately becomes an empty and dead ritual."

How, then, can we enter the Holy of Holies while we are still on earth? The secret is our spirit, referred to in <a href=Heb.htm#v4_12>4:12</a>. The very Christ who is in heaven is now also in our spirit (<a href=2Ti.htm#v4_22>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:22</a>). As the heavenly ladder (<a href=Gen.htm#v28_12>Gen. 28:12</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_51>John 1:51</a>), He joins our spirit to heaven and brings heaven into our spirit. Hence, whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies. There we meet with God, who is on the throne of grace.

BD["e)1\x9a"]="<b>unrighteousness</b><br> &emsp; Unrighteousness and sins are synonyms. All unrighteousness is sin (<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_17>5:17</a>). Both refer to our wrongdoings. Sins indicates the offense of our wrongdoings against God and men; unrighteousness indicates the stain of our wrongdoings, which causes us not to be right with either God or men. The offense needs God&rsquo;s forgiveness, and the stain requires His cleansing. Both God&rsquo;s forgiveness and God&rsquo;s cleansing are needed for the restoration of our broken fellowship with God, that we may enjoy Him in uninterrupted fellowship with a good conscience, a conscience void of offense (<a href=1Ti.htm#v1_5>1&nbsp;Tim. 1:5</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v24_16>Acts 24:16</a>)."
