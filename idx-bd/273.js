It will enable and qualify us to enter into the coming kingdom by all the riches of the divine life and divine nature as our excellent virtues (energy) unto the splendid glory of God.

Such a manifestation, corresponding with being touchable, indicates again the substantial nature of the Lord&rsquo;s humanity, which is the manifestation of the divine life in the New Testament economy."

She is concerned about how to perfect the younger ones to mature in life for the building up of the Body of Christ and to love Christ until they are betrothed to Him in love for the constituting of the bride of Christ (<a href=2Co.htm#v11_2>2&nbsp;Cor. 11:2</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v4_19>Gal. 4:19</a>)."

But He offered Himself through the eternal Spirit, who is of eternity and is not under the limitation of time. Hence, in the eyes of God, Christ as the Lamb of God was slain from the foundation of the world (<a href=Rev.htm#v13_8>Rev. 13:8</a>). His offering of Himself was once for all (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_27>7:27</a>), and the redemption consummated through His death is eternal (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_12>v. 12</a>), having an eternal effect.

BD["e))\x9b"]="<b>Word</b><br> &emsp; This is the Word mentioned in <a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>John 1:1</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_4>4</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>14</a>, who was with God and was God in eternity before creation, who became flesh in time, and in whom is life. This Word is the divine person of Christ as an account, a definition, and an expression of all that God is. In Him is life, and He is life (<a href=Joh.htm#v11_25>John 11:25</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v14_6>14:6</a>). The phrase the Word of life in Greek indicates that the Word is life. The person is the divine life, the eternal life, which we can touch. The mentioning of the Word here indicates that this Epistle is a continuation and development of John&rsquo;s Gospel (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>John 1:1</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_2>2</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>14</a>)."

This indicates that she is not sectarian in carrying out the Lord&rsquo;s work. She keeps the work open, so that others can come to sojourn there and she can go to sojourn elsewhere. This is to keep one work in one Body.<br> &emsp; To share in the work of the Lord is not to work for the Lord but to work together with the Lord (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_9>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:9a</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v6_1>2&nbsp;Cor. 6:1a</a>). To work with the Lord, we need the maturity in life, we need to be one with the Lord, and our work must be for His Body. The Shulammite works as Solomon&rsquo;s counterpart, taking care of all the vineyards (<a href=SoS.htm#v8_11>8:11</a>), the churches and the believers on the whole earth. This indicates that our work should be for the Body, not just one city. We must have a work that is for the entire world. This is what Paul did by establishing local churches and then working to bring them into the full realization of the Body of Christ."
