BD[":\xba+\x97"]="<b>princes</b><br> &emsp; Verses <a href=Psa.htm#v146_3>3</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v146_4>4</a> give the background of this psalm. Haggai and Zechariah, who were born in captivity, saw the kings of Babylon and Persia. This was why they said that we should not trust in princes."

BD["i*4\x97"]="<b>Pergamos</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means marriage (implying union) and fortified tower. As a sign, the church in Pergamos prefigures the church that entered into a marriage union with the world and became a high fortified tower, equivalent to the great tree prophesied by the Lord in the parable of the mustard seed (<a href=Mat.htm#v13_31>Matt. 13:31</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v13_32>32</a>). When Satan failed to destroy the church through the persecution of the Roman Empire in the first three centuries, he changed his strategy. He sought instead to corrupt her through Constantine&rsquo;s welcoming of Christianity as the state religion in the first part of the fourth century. Through Constantine&rsquo;s encouragement and political influence, multitudes of unbelievers were baptized into the &ldquo;church,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;church&rdquo; became monstrously great. Since the church as a chaste bride is espoused to Christ, her union with the world is considered spiritual fornication in the eyes of God."
BD["h)\@\x97"]="<b>But</b><br> &emsp; In this concluding praise the writer indicated clearly that although he had charged the believers to endeavor in the things mentioned in vv. <a href=Jud.htm#v20>20</a>-<a href=Jud.htm#v23>23</a>, only God our Savior was able to guard them from stumbling and set them before His glory without blemish in exultation. To Him be glory&hellip;!"

BD["i)7\x97"]="<b>feet</b><br> &emsp; Feet signify the walk. In typology bronze signifies divine judgment (<a href=Exo.htm#v27_1>Exo. 27:1</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v27_6>6</a>). The feet of Christ are like shining bronze, as mentioned also in <a href=Dan.htm#v10_6>Dan. 10:6</a>, signifying that His perfect and bright walk qualifies Him to exercise divine judgment. Hence, when He comes to possess the earth by judging it, His feet will be like pillars of fire (<a href=Rev.htm#v10_1>10:1</a>)."
BD["i)6\x9a"]="<b>fire</b><br> &emsp; This book has a judging nature. Fire is for divine judgment (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_13>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:13</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v6_8>Heb. 6:8</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_27>10:27</a>). &ldquo;Our God is also a consuming fire&rdquo; (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_29>Heb. 12:29</a>); His throne is a fiery flame and its wheels are burning fire, and a fiery stream issues and comes forth from before Him (<a href=Dan.htm#v7_9>Dan. 7:9</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v7_10>10</a>). All this is for judgment. The Lord&rsquo;s eyes being like a flame of fire is mainly for His judgment (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_18>2:18</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v2_23>23</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v19_11>19:11</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v19_12>12</a>). When He comes to take possession of the earth by exercising judgment over it, even His feet will be like pillars of fire (<a href=Rev.htm#v10_1>10:1</a>)."

BD["i,.\x97"]="<b>glassy</b><br> &emsp; This glassy sea is not of water but of fire (<a href=Rev.htm#v15_2>15:2</a>). Since the deluge, God, in accordance with His promise that He would not judge the earth and all living creatures again with water (<a href=Gen.htm#v9_15>Gen. 9:15</a>), always exercises His judgment upon man with fire (<a href=Gen.htm#v19_24>Gen. 19:24</a>; <a href=Lev.htm#v10_2>Lev. 10:2</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v11_1>Num. 11:1</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v16_35>16:35</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v7_11>Dan. 7:11</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v14_10>Rev. 14:10</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v18_8>18:8</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v19_20>19:20</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v20_9>20:9</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_10>10</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_8>21:8</a>). God&rsquo;s throne of judgment is like the fiery flame out of which a fiery stream issues (<a href=Dan.htm#v7_9>Dan. 7:9</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v7_10>10</a>). The flame of God&rsquo;s judging fire sweeps all negative things in the entire universe into this glassy sea, which eventually becomes the lake of fire (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_14>20:14</a>). The glassy sea, being the aggregate of all God&rsquo;s fiery judgment, is like crystal, signifying that every negative thing under God&rsquo;s judgment is crystal clear. Here we have the rainbow around the throne of God, signifying that God will keep His promise recorded in <a href=Gen.htm#v9_8>Gen. 9:8</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v9_17>17</a>. We also have the glassy sea of fire, indicating that God will judge all negative things still with fire."
