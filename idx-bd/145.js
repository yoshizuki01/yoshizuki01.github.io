BD["i*3\x98"]="<b>second</b><br> &emsp; Because of the fall and the entering in of sin, every man must die once (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_27>Heb. 9:27</a>). This first death, however, is not the final settlement. All the dead, except those who through faith in the Lord Jesus have been recorded in the book of life, will be resurrected and will pass through the judgment of the great white throne at the close of the millennium, i.e., at the conclusion of the old heaven and old earth. As a result of this judgment, the condemned ones will all be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death as the final settlement (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_11>20:11</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_15>15</a>). Hence, the second death is God&rsquo;s dealing with man after man&rsquo;s death and resurrection. Since the overcomers will have overcome death through their faithfulness unto death under persecution and will require no further dealing by God after their resurrection, they will be rewarded with the crown of life and will no longer be touched by death after their resurrection; i.e., they will not be hurt by the second death."

The vision in this chapter provides further details regarding the Persian Empire, the Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire, to the very end of the Roman Empire under Antichrist in the last three and a half years of this age (see <a href=DanN.htm#n2_32x1P2>note 32<sup>1</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=Dan.htm#v2>ch. 2</a>)."

BD["B2-\x97"]="<b>man</b><br> &emsp; Before the vision concerning the destiny of Israel was unveiled to Daniel, he was given a vision of the spiritual scene that is behind the physical situation (<a href=Dan.htm#v10_2>10:2</a>&mdash;<a href=Dan.htm#v11_1>11:1</a>). In this spiritual scene Christ is preeminent; hence, He is revealed first (vv. <a href=Dan.htm#v10_4>4</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v10_9>9</a>). Here the excellent Christ appeared to Daniel as a man for his appreciation, consolation, encouragement, expectation, and stabilization (cf. notes <a href=GenN.htm#n18_2x1>2<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v18>Gen. 18</a> and <a href=JdgN.htm#n13_6x1>6<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Jdg.htm#v13>Judg. 13</a>). He appeared to Daniel with many wonderful characteristics. First, He appeared as a Priest in His humanity, signified by the linen robe (<a href=Exo.htm#v28_31>Exo. 28:31</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v28_35>35</a>), to care for His chosen people in their captivity. Second, He appeared to Daniel in His kingship in His divinity, signified by the girdle of gold, for ruling over all the peoples. Furthermore, for His people&rsquo;s appreciation Christ appeared in His preciousness and dignity, as signified by His body being like beryl (<a href=Dan.htm#v10_6>v. 6a</a>). The Hebrew word for beryl could refer to a bluish-green or yellow precious stone, signifying that Christ in His embodiment is divine (yellow), full of life (green), and heavenly (blue). Christ also appeared in His brightness for shining over the people, as signified by His face being like the appearance of lightning (<a href=Dan.htm#v10_6>v. 6b</a>), and in His enlightening sight for searching and judging, as signified by His eyes being like torches of fire (<a href=Dan.htm#v10_6>v. 6c</a>). Moreover, Christ appeared in the gleam of His work and move, as signified by His arms and His feet being like the gleam of polished bronze (<a href=Dan.htm#v10_6>v. 6d</a>). Finally, Christ appeared to Daniel in His strong speaking for judging people, as signified by the sound of His words being like the sound of a multitude (<a href=Dan.htm#v10_6>v. 6e</a>). As a man, the very centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s move on earth for the carrying out of His economy, such a Christ is precious, valuable, complete, and perfect. Cf. <a href=Rev.htm#v1_13>Rev. 1:13</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v1_16>16</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n1_13x1>notes</a>."

After He receives the kingdom from God, He will come back to rule over the entire world (<a href=Luk.htm#v19_12>Luke 19:12</a>, <a href=Luk.htm#v19_15>15</a>). Christ&rsquo;s coming will terminate the entire human government on earth from its end to its beginning, and it will bring in the eternal kingdom of God (<a href=Dan.htm#v2_34>2:34</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v2_35>35</a>, <a href=Dan.htm#v2_44>44</a>).<br> &emsp; As implied in Daniel&rsquo;s vision, Christ accomplished redemption and then immediately came to God in ascension to receive the kingdom (cf. <a href=Rev.htm#v5_6>Rev. 5:6</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v5_7>7</a>). This is according to God&rsquo;s view, in which there is no time element. Like Abraham, David, and the other prophets, Daniel did not see the mystery of the church, which was hidden from the ages and from the generations but was revealed to the New Testament apostles and prophets (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_3>Eph. 3:3</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v3_11>11</a>). He did not realize that between the first and second appearings of Christ there would be a period of time during which God would do a marvelous and mysterious work based on Christ&rsquo;s redemption. This work is to regenerate His redeemed people and then sanctify them, renew them, transform them, and conform them to the glorious image of Christ (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:3</a>; <a href=1Th.htm#v5_23>1&nbsp;Thes. 5:23</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v4_16>2&nbsp;Cor. 4:16</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_18>3:18</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>Rom. 8:29</a>).

In reality, apart from Christ no one is righteous and upright in heart (<a href=Rom.htm#v3_10>Rom. 3:10</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v17_9>Jer. 17:9</a>). David&rsquo;s writing here is that of a person who tried to keep the law apart from Christ. In His economy God does not want us to endeavor to keep the law. He wants us to live Christ, the God-man, that He may be magnified (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_19>Phil. 1:19</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>21a</a>). To live Christ in order to magnify Him is to enjoy Him."
