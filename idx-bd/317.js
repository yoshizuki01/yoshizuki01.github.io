In preparing Moses as a savior for Israel, God used three women&mdash;Moses&rsquo; mother, Moses&rsquo; sister, and Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;to give him birth, to nurse him, to rescue him, to raise him, and to train him for His purpose (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v2_2>2</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v2_10>10</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v7_20>Acts 7:20</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v7_22>22</a>).
