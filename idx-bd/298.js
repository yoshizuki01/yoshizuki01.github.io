All things are wearisome, nothing is satisfying, there is nothing new, and nothing is remembered (vv. <a href=Ecc.htm#v1_8>8</a>-<a href=Ecc.htm#v1_11>11</a>). In his conclusion after all his experiments in the human life, all is vanity and a chasing after wind (vv. <a href=Ecc.htm#v1_2>2</a>, <a href=Ecc.htm#v1_14>14</a>). Such a conclusion of the wise king by his wisdom may be considered a history of the vain life of a fallen man. His conclusion in this book is like a dirge to a man whose end is in misery.<br> &emsp; All the unveilings that issued out of the writer&rsquo;s experiments and searching and testing should not be considered the divine revelation from God concerning His divine purpose for human life, though they are included in the Scriptures under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. They are the conclusion of the writer&rsquo;s research in his experiments in the realm of the human life of fallen man under the sun. In the divine intention all the concluding words may be considered proverbs, words of wisdom, that direct fallen and aim-missing men to return to God (<a href=Ecc.htm#v12_1>12:1a</a>, <a href=Ecc.htm#v12_13>13</a>-<a href=Ecc.htm#v12_14>14</a>) and receive Him, according to His New Testament economy, in His Son as their Redeemer and life, that they may be regenerated to be the God-men for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.

BD["925\x97"]="<b>hidden</b><br> &emsp; This indicates that Job could not find the reason for God&rsquo;s treatment of him, but he believed that there had to be some reason hidden in God&rsquo;s heart. Job was right; something was hidden in God&rsquo;s heart&mdash;the mystery of the ages (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_9>Eph. 3:9</a>). After creating man in His image and according to His likeness (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_26>Gen. 1:26</a>), God kept His intention hidden throughout the ages. Before the New Testament time He did not unveil to anyone what His purpose was (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_4>Eph. 3:4</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v3_5>5</a>).<br> &emsp; The mystery hidden in God&rsquo;s heart is God&rsquo;s eternal economy (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_10>Eph. 1:10</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v3_9>3:9</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v1_4>1&nbsp;Tim. 1:4</a>), which is God&rsquo;s eternal intention with His heart&rsquo;s desire to dispense Himself in His Divine Trinity as the Father in the Son by the Spirit into His chosen people to be their life and nature that they may be the same as He is as His duplication (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>Rom. 8:29</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_2>1&nbsp;John 3:2</a>), to become an organism, the Body of Christ as the new man (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_15>Eph. 2:15</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_16>16</a>), for God&rsquo;s fullness, God&rsquo;s expression (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_22>Eph. 1:22</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>23</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v3_19>3:19</a>), which will consummate in the New Jerusalem (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>Rev. 21:2</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>22:5</a>). Not knowing God&rsquo;s intention, Job misunderstood God and thought that God was angry with him and was judging him and punishing him. God&rsquo;s intention was not to judge Job or to punish him but to tear him down and then rebuild him with Himself, to make Job a new man in God&rsquo;s new creation (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:17</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v6_15>Gal. 6:15</a>). This is the answer to Job, to the book of Job, and to Job&rsquo;s vindication."

BD["=),\x97"]="<b>Draw</b><br> &emsp; In her pursuing of Christ for satisfaction, the lover of Christ asks Him to draw her that she and her companions (&ldquo;we&rdquo;) may run after Him. For the accomplishing of His eternal economy, God created man in His own image so that man may express Him (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_26>Gen. 1:26</a>). He also created man with a spirit so that man may receive Him and contain Him (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_7>Gen. 2:7</a>; <a href=Zec.htm#v12_1>Zech. 12:1</a>), and with a heart that seeks God Himself so that God can be man&rsquo;s satisfaction (<a href=Ecc.htm#v3_11>Eccl. 3:11</a>). Although man fell away from God, and sin through Satan came in to frustrate man from receiving God for his satisfaction, the desire for God, the seeking for God, still remains in man&rsquo;s heart. This book tells us the unique way to be properly satisfied with God&mdash;to pursue and gain Christ (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_7>Phil. 3:7</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_14>14</a>), who as the very embodiment and reality of God (<a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_18>John 1:18</a>) came to earth that man might receive Him for satisfaction.
