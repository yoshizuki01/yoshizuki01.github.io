The apostle&rsquo;s word here implies that the Corinthians&rsquo; inconsiderate eating of idol sacrifices was also somewhat related to idolatry."

The Father&rsquo;s divine element, which is the eternal life, was in the incarnated Son. The shell of the Son&rsquo;s incarnation had to be broken through death that the Father&rsquo;s divine element, the eternal life, might be released and expressed in resurrection, just as the life element of a grain of wheat is released by the breaking of its shell and is expressed by its blossom. This is the glorification of God the Father in the Son. See <a href=JohN.htm#n17_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Joh.htm#v17>ch. 17</a>."

BD["S8/\x97"]="<b>Spirit</b><br> &emsp; The Spirit of Jesus and the Holy Spirit in the preceding verse are used interchangeably, revealing that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a general title of the Spirit of God in the New Testament; the Spirit of Jesus is a particular expression concerning the Spirit of God and refers to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in His humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross. This indicates that in the Spirit of Jesus there is not only the divine element of God but also the human element of Jesus and the elements of His human living and His suffering of death as well. Such an all-inclusive Spirit was needed for the apostle&rsquo;s preaching ministry, a ministry of suffering carried out among human beings and for human beings in the human life."

In order that the church might be constituted and realized in a practical, experiential way, he presented himself as a steward (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_2>v. 2</a>), as one who had received grace (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_2>v. 2</a>) and revelation (vv. <a href=Eph.htm#v3_3>3</a>, <a href=Eph.htm#v3_5>5</a>) and had become a minister of the high gospel, announcing the riches of Christ as the gospel for the producing of the church."
