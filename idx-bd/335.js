BD["Z)B\x97"]="<b>mystery</b><br> &emsp; According to Greek grammar, the mystery in this verse is in apposition to the word of God in <a href=Col.htm#v1_25>v. 25</a>, showing that the mystery is the word of God. This mystery concerns Christ and the church (<a href=Eph.htm#v5_32>Eph. 5:32</a>), the Head and the Body. The unveiling of this mystery through the apostle Paul is the completing of the word of God as the divine revelation."
BD["U6H\x97"]="<b>spirits</b><br> &emsp; This means that the prophets are not under the control of their spirits, but their spirits are under their direction. Thus, they can determine when to prophesy and when to cease prophesying, to maintain good order in the church meeting. Their spirits are not their master but their means to function. They should learn how to exercise and use their spirits at their discretion."
BD["Z)A\x9a"]="<b>complete</b><br> &emsp; The word of God is the divine revelation, which had not been completed before the New Testament was written. In the New Testament the apostles, especially the apostle Paul, completed the word of God in regard to the mystery of God, which is Christ, and the mystery of Christ, which is the church, to give us a full revelation of God&rsquo;s economy."

BD["[,/\x9a"]="<b>sanctification</b><br> &emsp; The apostle&rsquo;s charge to abstain from fornication is based on sanctification (<a href=1Th.htm#v4_3>v. 3</a>), strengthened by sanctification (<a href=1Th.htm#v4_4>v. 4</a>), and concluded here with sanctification, because fornication, the most unclean thing, destroys the holy standing and character of God&rsquo;s called saints."
BD["[+3\x97"]="<b>make</b><br> &emsp; In Greek, make straight here is singular. This indicates that the apostle considered that God the Father and the Lord Jesus are one.
