A false Christ is one who pretends, deceivingly, to be the Christ, whereas an antichrist is one who denies Christ&rsquo;s deity, denying that Jesus is the Christ, that is, denying the Father and the Son by denying that Jesus is the Son of God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_22>v. 22</a> and <a href=1JoN.htm#n2_22x2>note 2</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_23>v. 23</a>), not confessing that He has come in the flesh through the divine conception of the Holy Spirit (<a href=1Jo.htm#v4_2>4:2</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v4_3>3</a>)."

BD[":>4\x97"]="<b>Many</b><br> &emsp; Verses <a href=Psa.htm#v22_12>12</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v22_18>18</a> depict in vivid detail how Christ passed through His suffering of crucifixion (cf. <a href=Mrk.htm#v15_16>Mark 15:16</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v15_37>37</a>). While Christ was being crucified on the cross, many fierce men, signified by mighty bulls, encompassed Him (<a href=Psa.htm#v22_12>v. 12</a>). They opened their mouth at Him like a ravening and roaring lion (<a href=Psa.htm#v22_13>v. 13</a>). Evil men, signified by dogs (cf. <a href=Phi.htm#v3_2>Phil. 3:2a</a>), surrounded Him, and a congregation of evildoers enclosed Him (<a href=Psa.htm#v22_16>v. 16a-b</a>). They pierced His hands and feet (<a href=Psa.htm#v22_16>v. 16c</a>). They divided His garments to themselves, and for His clothing they cast lots (<a href=Psa.htm#v22_18>v. 18</a>). They also looked, stared at Him with contempt and hatred (<a href=Psa.htm#v22_17>v. 17b</a>). On the cross He was poured out like water (<a href=Psa.htm#v22_14>v. 14a</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v53_12>Isa. 53:12</a>). All His bones were out of joint (<a href=Psa.htm#v22_14>v. 14b</a>) because He could not hold up the weight of His body as it hung on the cross. This caused Him great agony and pain. Also, He counted all His bones (<a href=Psa.htm#v22_17>v. 17a</a>). His heart was like wax melted within Him (<a href=Psa.htm#v22_14>v. 14c-d</a>). His strength was dried up like a shard (<a href=Psa.htm#v22_15>v. 15a</a>), a piece of broken pottery. His tongue was stuck to His jaws (<a href=Psa.htm#v22_15>v. 15b</a>). God had put Him in the dust of death (<a href=Psa.htm#v22_15>v. 15c</a>)."
BD["g)+\x98"]="<b>your</b><br> &emsp; Lit., your truth. This is the truth concerning Christ, especially His deity (see <a href=2JoN.htm#n1x5>note 1<sup>5</sup></a> in 2&nbsp;John). By the revelation of this truth the recipient&rsquo;s way of life was determined, and the recipient held to this truth as his fundamental belief. It is the objective truth that had become subjective in the recipient&rsquo;s daily walk."
BD[">4.\x97"]="<b>ringing</b><br> &emsp; A ringing shout is a shout that continues to sound. Joy is inward, but rejoicing (<a href=Isa.htm#v12_3>v. 3</a>) involves some activity to express the joy that is within. This rejoicing is related to giving a ringing shout, that is, to rejoicing in a continuing way."
BD["g)*\x9b"]="<b>soul</b><br> &emsp; Man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body (<a href=1Th.htm#v5_23>1&nbsp;Thes. 5:23</a> and <a href=1ThN.htm#n5_23x5>note 5</a>). The soul is the organ that mediates between the body and the spirit; it possesses self-consciousness, that man may have his personality. It is contained in the body and is the vessel to contain the spirit. As to the believer, God as the Spirit dwells in his regenerated spirit (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_9>Rom. 8:9</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v8_16>16</a>) and spreads from his spirit to saturate his soul that it may be transformed to express Him (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_2>Rom. 12:2</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_18>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18</a>). This is the prosperity of the believer&rsquo;s soul. When our soul is occupied and directed by the Spirit of God through our spirit so that it directs and uses our body for God&rsquo;s purposes, it prospers. The apostle wished that the recipient, who was a beloved brother, outstanding in such a prosperity of his soul, might prosper in all things and in bodily health, just as his soul prospered in the divine life."

In chs. <a href=Dan.htm#v1>1</a>&mdash;<a href=Dan.htm#v6>6</a> this book presents God&rsquo;s economy not in theology or in teaching but in a series of six cases as illustrations to show what God&rsquo;s economy is and how God&rsquo;s economy can be carried out."

The source of Eliphaz&rsquo;s teaching is not divine revelation but human logic. Furthermore, his teaching is based on the principle of good and evil, which is the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>Gen. 2:9</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v2_17>17</a>)."

Hence, when we love one another, God abides in us and His love is manifested perfectly in us."

BD["a4\@\x98"]="<b>blood</b><br> &emsp; In this book the blood of Christ is particularly prominent and crucial. It is the blood of the eternal covenant (<a href=Heb.htm#v13_20>13:20</a>), with which the new and better covenant was enacted (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_29>10:29</a>). Through this blood Christ entered once for all into the Holy of Holies and obtained an eternal redemption for us (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_12>9:12</a>). By this blood Christ cleansed the heavens and all things in the heavens (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_22>9:22</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v9_24>24</a>). This blood sanctifies us (<a href=Heb.htm#v13_12>13:12</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_29>10:29</a>), purifies our conscience to serve the living God (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_14>9:14</a>), and speaks something better for us than the blood of Abel (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_24>v. 24</a>). It is in this blood that we have boldness for entering the Holy of Holies (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_19>10:19</a>).

BD["e+7\x98"]="<b>murderer</b><br> &emsp; Murderer here does not denote an actual murderer but indicates that in spiritual ethics hating equals murdering. No actual murderer (an unsaved person), as Cain was (<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_12>v. 12</a>), has eternal life abiding in him. Since we know this, we, who have passed out of death into life and have eternal life abiding in us, should not behave like an unsaved murderer by hating our brothers in the Lord. This section concerns the life that abides in the Lord. A believer who has eternal life but does not abide in the Lord and let the Lord, who is the eternal life, abide and work in him might hate a brother and commit other sins occasionally. But this would not be habitual."

BD["A)4\x97"]="<b>straight</b><br> &emsp; Lit., in the direction of their faces. The move of the living creatures is not individual but corporate. They move as one entity in coordination. Each of the living creatures faces one direction. As they face these four directions, two of their wings spread out and touch the adjacent creatures&rsquo; wings, forming a square. When the living creatures move, they do not need to turn; one moves straight forward while the opposite creature moves backward and the other two move sideways (<a href=Ezk.htm#v1_9>v. 9</a>). This is a beautiful picture of the coordination in the church as the Body of Christ, in which each member has his particular position and function, or ministry (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_4>Rom. 12:4</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v12_8>8</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v12_14>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:14</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v12_30>30</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v4_7>Eph. 4:7</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v4_16>16</a>). When one member functions, he moves &ldquo;straight forward&rdquo; to fulfill his function, and the other members accommodate him by moving in the same direction, some moving &ldquo;backward&rdquo; and others moving &ldquo;sideways.&rdquo;<br> &emsp; According to the vision of the four living creatures, the coordination of the believers as members of the Body of Christ results in the corporate expression of God in Christ, in the move of God on the earth, and in the administration of God on the throne, thus affording God a way to manifest His glory and accomplish His eternal purpose and plan. In order to participate in such a coordination, we need to have the spiritual experiences and the practical living symbolized by the details in vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v1_4>4</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v1_12>12</a>."
