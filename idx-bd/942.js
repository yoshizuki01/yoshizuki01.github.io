Here in vv. <a href=Mat.htm#v9_14>14</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v9_17>17</a> the Lord dealt with the problem of John&rsquo;s disciples, who were of the new religion. John the Baptist had dropped the old religion and had begun his ministry in the wilderness, outside religion. (See notes <a href=MatN.htm#n3_1x2>1<sup>2</sup></a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n3_4x1>4<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v3>ch. 3</a>.) However, after a short time his disciples formed a new religion that frustrated people from enjoying Christ, just as the Pharisees of the old religion had done. John the Baptist&rsquo;s ministry was to introduce people to Christ that Christ might become their Redeemer, their life, and their all. However, some of John&rsquo;s disciples drifted away from his goal, Christ, to some of his practices, and made those practices a religion. To be religious is to do something for God, without Christ. To do anything, even if it is scriptural and fundamental, without the presence of Christ is to be religious. Both John&rsquo;s disciples, who were of the new religion, and the Pharisees, who were of the old religion, fasted much, but without Christ. Meanwhile, they condemned the disciples of Christ, who did not fast but had Christ with them and lived in His presence."

BD["APW\x97"]="<b>altar</b><br> &emsp; The altar, which signifies the cross of Christ, is the center not only of the inner court but also of the entire premises of the temple. This altar is actually the center of the universe. As the center of the universe, the cross points to the all-inclusive death of Christ, which involved God, man, and all the creatures (see <a href=EzkN.htm#n43_13x2>note 13<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Ezk.htm#v43>ch. 43</a>). The death on the cross was the release of God (<a href=Luk.htm#v12_49>Luke 12:49</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v12_50>50</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v12_24>John 12:24</a>) and the termination of man and all negative things (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_6>Rom. 6:6</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v2_14>Heb. 2:14</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v9_26>9:26</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v9_28>28</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v6_14>Gal. 6:14</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_14>Eph. 2:14</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_15>15</a>). In Christ&rsquo;s death God passed through death in man to be released, and man died in God to be terminated.<br> &emsp; The cross is not only the center but also the circumference of God&rsquo;s holy building. The cross is implied in the gate, in the eating of the sacrifices, in the boiling houses, and in the tables on which the sacrifices are slain. Thus, the cross spreads in every direction and to every corner of God&rsquo;s building. If we wish to contact God and enjoy His riches in His house, we must pass through the cross."
