That the judgment on Edom is repeated here (cf. <a href=Ezk.htm#v25_12>25:12</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v25_14>14</a>) indicates that in the process of God&rsquo;s recovery by life, there is still the need of God&rsquo;s judgment, particularly on Edom, who typifies the old man (see <a href=EzkN.htm#n25_12x1>note 12<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Ezk.htm#v25>ch. 25</a>). Because the old man is very difficult to deal with, the judgment on the old man must be repeated again and again, until the day of the redemption of our body (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_30>Eph. 4:30</a>). In order to recover us and make us the new man, God must judge our old man, our old creation (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_6>Rom. 6:6</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v4_22>Eph. 4:22</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v4_24>24</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v3_9>Col. 3:9</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v3_11>11</a>)."
