God did not consider either heaven or earth His dwelling place, nor did He consider the physical house, the temple, built for Him by the children of Israel the place of His rest. In the Old Testament both the tabernacle and the temple were only symbols of God&rsquo;s union with the children of Israel, whom God considered His actual house (<a href=Heb.htm#v3_6>Heb. 3:6</a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n3_6x1>note</a>). God was united with the children of Israel and became one entity with them, and this one entity was a spiritual house in which both God and the godly people in Israel dwelt (<a href=Psa.htm#v27_4>Psa. 27:4</a>; <a href=Psa.htm#v84_10>84:10</a>; <a href=Psa.htm#v90_1>90:1</a>; cf. <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5a</a>). According to <a href=Isa.htm#v66_2>v. 2</a> and <a href=Isa.htm#v57_15>57:15</a>, the dwelling place God desires to have is a group of people into whom He can enter. God intends to have a dwelling place in the universe that is the mingling of God and man, in which God is built into man and man is built into God, so that God and man, man and God, can be a mutual abode to each other (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_2>John 14:2</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v14_20>20</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v14_23>23</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v15_4>15:4</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v4_13>1&nbsp;John 4:13</a>). In the New Testament this dwelling place, this house, is the church, which is God&rsquo;s habitation in the believers&rsquo; spirit (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>Eph. 2:22</a> and <a href=EphN.htm#n2_22x4>note 4</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a> and <a href=1TiN.htm#n3_15x2>note 2</a>). The ultimate manifestation of this universal building, this universal house, is the New Jerusalem. In this city God is in man, taking man as His dwelling place, and man is in God, taking God as His habitation (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>Rev. 21:3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_22>22</a>, and <a href=RevN.htm#n21_22x1>notes</a>).

The hand is a member of the body, and the sheep is a member of the flock. The Lord would do anything for the healing of His members, for the rescue of His fallen sheep.

It was not only the early believers who were not clear concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in relation to the Judaic temple; even the early apostles did not have a clear vision concerning God&rsquo;s abandoning of the Judaic things. Hence, even after God poured out the Spirit upon them on the day of Pentecost to initiate a new dispensation, they still would not separate themselves from the Judaic temple. At the initial stage God tolerated their ignorance in this matter. But this led to a mixture of the church with Judaism, which was not condemned by the early church in Jerusalem (cf. <a href=Act.htm#v21_20>21:20</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v21_26>26</a>). Eventually, the temple was destroyed by Titus with his Roman army in A.D. 70, as prophesied by the Lord in <a href=Mat.htm#v23_38>Matt. 23:38</a> and <a href=Mat.htm#v24_2>24:2</a>.
