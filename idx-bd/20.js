Then, in His heavenly ministry Christ was designated a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek (<a href=Heb.htm#v5_6>Heb. 5:6</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v5_10>10</a>), not to offer sacrifices for sin but to minister to us the very God who was processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, signified by the bread and the wine (<a href=Mat.htm#v26_26>Matt. 26:26</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v26_28>28</a>), as our life supply that we may be saved to the uttermost (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_25>Heb. 7:25a</a>).

In particular, these psalms reveal the way of restoration&mdash;to exalt Christ. These seven psalms were written by Asaph, a Levite who had served in the temple. The fact that these psalms speak of the desolation of the temple, the city of Jerusalem, and the people indicates that they were written after the children of Israel had been taken captive to Babylon."
BD["S*)\x97"]="<b>Pentecost</b><br> &emsp; Meaning fiftieth. It was the fiftieth day from the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, there being seven weeks in between, counting from the second day (the first day of the week&mdash;<a href=Luk.htm#v23_54>Luke 23:54</a>&mdash;<a href=Luk.htm#v24_1>24:1</a>) after the Passover on which the Lord was crucified (<a href=Joh.htm#v19_14>John 19:14</a>). It was the fulfillment of the Feast of Weeks (<a href=Deu.htm#v16_10>Deut. 16:10</a>), which was also called the Feast of Harvest (<a href=Exo.htm#v23_16>Exo. 23:16</a>), and was counted from the day of the offering of a sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest, to the day after the seventh Sabbath (<a href=Lev.htm#v23_10>Lev. 23:10</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v23_11>11</a>, <a href=Lev.htm#v23_15>15</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v23_16>16</a>). The sheaf of the firstfruits offered before God was a type of the resurrected Christ offered to God on the day of His resurrection (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_17>John 20:17</a>), which was the day after the Sabbath (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_1>John 20:1</a>). From that day to the day of Pentecost there were exactly fifty days (cf. <a href=Act.htm#v1_3>1:3</a>). The Feast of Harvest typifies the enjoyment of the rich produce brought in by the resurrected Christ. This rich produce is the all-inclusive Spirit of the processed Triune God, given by Him to His chosen people as the blessing of the gospel (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_14>Gal. 3:14</a>) that they may enjoy the all-inclusive Christ (the very embodiment of the Triune God) as their good land. This signifies that the believers, by receiving the bountiful Spirit on the day of Pentecost, not only have entered into the good land but also have participated in the bountiful riches of the all-inclusive Christ (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_8>Eph. 3:8</a>) in His resurrection and ascension, as God&rsquo;s full allotment in His New Testament economy."
BD["S),\x97"]="<b>met</b><br> &emsp; Or, ate together."
BD["O18\x97"]="<b>unfulled</b><br> &emsp; Or, new, raw, unwrought. The Greek word is formed with not and to card or comb wool. Thus, the word means uncarded, unsteamed and unwashed, unfinished, unfulled, untreated. The unfulled cloth signifies Christ from His incarnation to His crucifixion, as a piece of new cloth, untreated, unfinished; whereas the new garment in <a href=Luk.htm#v5_36>Luke 5:36</a> signifies Christ as a new robe after He was &ldquo;treated&rdquo; in His crucifixion. (The Greek word for new in <a href=Luk.htm#v5_36>Luke 5:36</a> is the same as for fresh in <a href=Mat.htm#v9_17>Matt. 9:17</a>.) Christ first was the unfulled cloth for making a new garment, and then through His death and resurrection was made a new garment to cover us as our righteousness before God that we might be justified by God and be acceptable to Him (<a href=Luk.htm#v15_22>Luke 15:22</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v3_27>Gal. 3:27</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>). A patch of unfulled cloth sewn on an old garment pulls away from the garment because of the strength of its shrinking, thus making the tear worse. To sew a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment means to imitate what Christ did in His human life on earth. This is what today&rsquo;s modernists are attempting to do. They only imitate Jesus&rsquo; human deeds to improve their behavior; they do not believe in the crucified Jesus as their Redeemer or in the resurrected Christ as their righteousness that they may be justified by God and acceptable to Him. Their imitating of Christ&rsquo;s human living &ldquo;pulls away&rdquo; from their &ldquo;old garment,&rdquo; their behavior produced by their old, natural life. The kingdom people would not do this; they take the crucified and resurrected Christ as their new garment to cover them as their righteousness before God."
BD["S)+\x9a"]="<b>kingdom</b><br> &emsp; This proves that the kingdom of God would be the main subject of the apostles&rsquo; preaching in their commission that was to come after Pentecost (<a href=Act.htm#v8_12>8:12</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v14_22>14:22</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v19_8>19:8</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v20_25>20:25</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v28_23>28:23</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v28_31>31</a>). It is not a material kingdom visible to human sight but a kingdom of the divine life. It is the spreading of Christ as life to His believers to form a realm in which God rules in His life. See notes <a href=MrkN.htm#n1_15x1>15<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mrk.htm#v1>Mark 1</a>, <a href=MrkN.htm#n4_26x1>26<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mrk.htm#v4>Mark 4</a>, and <a href=LukN.htm#n4_43x2>43<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Luk.htm#v4>Luke 4</a>."
