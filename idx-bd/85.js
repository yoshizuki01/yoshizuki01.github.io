BD["O19\x99"]="<b>fresh</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word for fresh means new in nature, quality, or form; unaccustomed, unused; hence, fresh. The fresh wineskins signify the church life in the local churches as the container of the new wine, which is Christ Himself as the exciting life. The kingdom people are built into the church (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>16:18</a>), and the church is expressed through the local churches in which the kingdom people live (<a href=Mat.htm#v18_15>18:15</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v18_20>20</a>). They are regenerated persons who constitute the Body of Christ and become the church (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_5>Rom. 12:5</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v1_22>Eph. 1:22</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>23</a>). The Body of Christ as His fullness is also called &ldquo;the Christ&rdquo; (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_12>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:12</a>), referring to the corporate Christ. The individual Christ is the new wine, the inward exciting life, and the corporate Christ is the fresh wineskin, the outward container that holds the new wine. With the kingdom people it is not a matter of fasting or any other religious practice, but a matter of the church life with Christ as their content. Christ came to establish not an earthly religion of rituals but a heavenly kingdom of life. He is establishing such a kingdom not with any dead religious practices but with Himself, the living person, as the Savior, the Physician, the Bridegroom, the unfulled cloth, and the new wine to His followers for their full enjoyment, that they may be the fresh wineskin to contain Him and may become the constituents of His kingdom."
