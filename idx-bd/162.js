The birth of Christ was directly of the Holy Spirit (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_20>v. 20</a>). His source was the Holy Spirit and His element was divine. Through the virgin Mary He put on flesh and blood, the human nature, taking the likeness of the flesh (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_3>Rom. 8:3</a>), the likeness of men (<a href=Phi.htm#v2_7>Phil. 2:7</a>)."
BD["O)9\x9a"]="<b>until</b><br> &emsp; Luke&rsquo;s record begins with Jesus and traces back to God. Matthew&rsquo;s record proceeds from Abraham to Christ. Luke goes back and up to God; Matthew comes forward and down to Christ. All the generations were directed to Christ and brought in Christ. Christ is the goal, the consummation, the conclusion, the completion, and the perfection of all the generations; as such, He fulfills their prophecies, solves their problems, and meets their needs. When Christ comes, light, life, salvation, satisfaction, healing, freedom, rest, comfort, peace, and joy all come with Him. From this point on, the whole New Testament is a full expounding of this wonderful Christ, who is everything to us. Hallelujah, Christ has come!"
