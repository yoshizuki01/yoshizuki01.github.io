At this point He is coming down out of heaven. This vision, part of the insertion between the sixth and seventh trumpets, is a hint that before the seventh trumpet, Christ is on the way to earth.

To be on the cloud is to come openly, whereas to be clothed with a cloud is to come secretly. This indicates that even after the sixth trumpet, Christ still is coming secretly, not openly. He will come secretly until He is seen by all the tribes of the earth, as mentioned in <a href=Rev.htm#v1_7>1:7</a> and <a href=Mat.htm#v24_30>Matt. 24:30</a>, at which time He will come openly."
