BD[">L)\x97"]="<b>Hezekiah</b><br> &emsp; The first thirty-five chapters of this book concern God&rsquo;s loving chastisement on His beloved Israel and His righteous judgment on the nations, in order that His elect might turn to Him so that the created things might be restored and the all-inclusive Christ might be brought in. At this point, everyone and everything have been discharged by God, and Christ, the only One who is qualified, has come. In chs. <a href=Isa.htm#v36>36</a>&mdash;<a href=Isa.htm#v39>39</a> Isaiah provides an example in the person of Hezekiah, the king of Judah. In this example Isaiah shows how a person such as Hezekiah, who was appointed a king in God&rsquo;s kingdom, who was godly, and who prayed and received miraculous answers from God, eventually became not a success but a failure because of his self-glory and self-interest. Hence, he too was eventually discharged by God. See <a href=IsaN.htm#n37_1x1>notes</a> in chs. <a href=Isa.htm#v37>37</a>&mdash;<a href=Isa.htm#v39>39</a>."
