BD[":\x9fZ\x97"]="<b>enlivened</b><br> &emsp; There are two aspects of the law&mdash;the aspect of the letter and the aspect of the Spirit. &ldquo;The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life&rdquo; (<a href=2Co.htm#v3_6>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:6</a>). If our attitude in coming to the law is to care only for the commandments in letters, we will have the law in the aspect of the killing letter. However, if we take every part of the law&mdash;all the commandments, ordinances, statutes, precepts, and judgments&mdash;as the word breathed out by the God whom we love, we will have the law in the aspect of the life-giving Spirit.<br> &emsp; The function of the law also has two aspects. On the negative side, the law exposes man&rsquo;s sin (<a href=Rom.htm#v3_20>Rom. 3:20b</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v7_7>7:7b</a>) and subdues sinners before God (<a href=Rom.htm#v3_19>Rom. 3:19</a>). It also guards God&rsquo;s chosen people in its custody that they might be conducted to Christ (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_23>Gal. 3:23</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v3_24>24</a>). On the positive side, as God&rsquo;s living testimony, the law functions to minister the living God to His seekers (vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v119_2>2</a>, <a href=Psa.htm#v119_88>88</a>), and as God&rsquo;s living word, the law functions to dispense God Himself as life and light into those who love the law (vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v119_25>25</a>, <a href=Psa.htm#v119_116>116</a>, <a href=Psa.htm#v119_130>130</a>).

BD["e,/\x9a"]="<b>begotten</b><br> &emsp; The apostle&rsquo;s emphasis here is still the divine birth, through which the divine life has been imparted into the believers, the life that affords them the life ability to know God. This divine birth is the basic factor of brotherly love, which is a higher condition of the life that abides in the Lord.

BD["a2B\x97"]="<b>sin</b><br> &emsp; To sin willfully here means to abandon one&rsquo;s own assembling together with the church. The Hebrew believers had been instructed to abandon Judaism and remain under the new covenant. If they had still returned to Judaism, they would have abandoned their own assembling with the church. This would have constituted a willful sin in the eyes of God, in that it would have been committed after they had received the knowledge of the truth, after they had come to know that God had abandoned Judaism, which was formed according to the old covenant, and had initiated the new and living way of contacting God according to the new covenant."
