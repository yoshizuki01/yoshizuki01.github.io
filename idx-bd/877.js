When the Ark of God went with the children of Israel, the Triune God went with them, taking the lead and thus being the first to step into the water.

Just as David and his followers were not held guilty, so Christ and His disciples should not have been condemned.<br> &emsp; Furthermore, the Lord&rsquo;s word here implies the dispensational change from the priesthood to the kingship. In the ancient time the coming of David changed the dispensation from the age of the priests to the age of the kings, in which the kings were above the priests. In the age of the priests the leader of the people had to listen to the priest (<a href=Num.htm#v27_21>Num. 27:21</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v27_22>22</a>).
