The command, on God&rsquo;s side, speaks for Him and requires something of us for Him. Faith, on our side, responds to God&rsquo;s requirements and receives His life. Faith is a proclamation that we are unable to fulfill God&rsquo;s requirements but that God has done everything for us and that we receive what He has done. The life promised by God is what we have received of Him for the carrying out of His demand. It was in this way that Paul was an apostle to administrate God&rsquo;s New Testament economy."
