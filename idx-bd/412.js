The limiting of the time of the redemption of such houses to one year after the sale (vv. <a href=Lev.htm#v25_29>29</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v25_30>30</a>) signifies that if a believer has lost the enjoyment of the church life, it can be restored only within a short limit of God&rsquo;s grace, as indicated by the one year. If the lost enjoyment of the church life is not restored in the church age, the age of grace, it will still be lost in the millennium, the age of the kingdom. This is according to the principle of taking away from him who has not (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_29>Matt. 25:29</a>).

His many brothers are the many sons of God and are the church (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_10>Heb. 2:10</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v2_12>12</a>), a corporate expression of God the Father in the Son.

BD[",C-\x97"]="<b>altar</b><br> &emsp; The children of Israel, being fallen in nature, surely would not measure up to keeping the commandments, statutes, and ordinances of their God; thus, they would come under all the curses listed in vv. <a href=Deu.htm#v27_15>15</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v27_26>26</a>. However, right beside the stones containing the inscriptions of the commandments of God was the altar, signifying the cross of Christ, where God&rsquo;s people could take Christ, in type, as their burnt offering to God for His satisfaction and as their peace offering to God for their enjoyment with God in the divine fellowship (vv. <a href=Deu.htm#v27_6>6</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v27_7>7</a>). Through Christ God&rsquo;s people, who were cursed under God&rsquo;s commandments, statutes, and ordinances, have been redeemed &ldquo;out of the curse of the law&rdquo; (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_13>Gal. 3:13</a>). Because we as God&rsquo;s people have come to the cross, we are now under the cross (implying grace) and are no longer under the law (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_14>Rom. 6:14</a>). As those who are under the cross, we can satisfy God and can also find satisfaction for ourselves through Christ, our Redeemer and our Substitute. Through Christ, who is our peace, we have peace with God (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_14>Eph. 2:14a</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v5_1>Rom. 5:1</a>). The law is over, and the cross stands forever. This is the reason that the altar was prepared before the curses were declared.<br> &emsp; The scene at the entry of the good land portrayed in vv. <a href=Deu.htm#v27_1>1</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v27_8>8</a> includes the stone monuments, the altar, and the offerings. The law written on the monuments was a portrait of God Himself (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n20_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v20>Exo. 20</a>); hence, the monuments signify that Christ as the embodiment of God was standing before the people to make requirements of them according to what He is. The offerings burned on the altar as sacrifices for God&rsquo;s satisfaction also signify Christ as the One who meets and satisfies all God&rsquo;s requirements. Thus, the requiring God Himself came in incarnation to be our Redeemer and our Substitute as the fulfilling One. This wonderful scene shows that it is through the requiring God, the cross of Christ, and Christ Himself as the offerings, not by our endeavoring in ourselves, that we enter into Christ, our good land, and receive all the blessings that God would give us in Christ. These blessings are the processed Triune God Himself embodied in Christ (see <a href=DeuN.htm#n8_7x1>note 7<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Deu.htm#v8>ch. 8</a>)."

If we are righteous, right, and proper toward others, toward things, and toward God, we will have a peaceful relationship with others and with God. Thus, we will have joy in the Holy Spirit and, in particular, before God. In this way we will be filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit (<a href=Act.htm#v13_52>Acts 13:52</a>) and will live out righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, which are the reality of the kingdom of God.<br> &emsp; According to the context of this chapter, this verse was written for our receiving of the believers. If we receive the believers according to the apostle&rsquo;s instruction in this chapter, we will be right and proper toward those whom we receive and will have peace with them; thus, we will have joy in the Holy Spirit, proving that we are living in the reality of God&rsquo;s kingdom and are under God&rsquo;s rule. Otherwise, we will not be right or proper toward those whom we do not receive and will not have peace with them; thus, we will not have joy in the Holy Spirit before God, proving that we are not subject to God&rsquo;s authority in the kingdom of God."
BD["OAI\x8c"]="And He will set the sheep on His right hand and the goats on the left."
BD["OBB\x98"]="<b>bread</b><br> &emsp; The bread of the Lord&rsquo;s table is a symbol signifying the Lord&rsquo;s body, which was broken for us on the cross to release His life that we may participate in it. By participating in this life we become the mystical Body of Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_27>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:27</a>), which also is signified by the bread of the table (<a href=1Co.htm#v10_17>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:17</a>). Hence, by partaking of this bread we have the fellowship of the Body of Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v10_16>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:16</a>)."
BD["O\@L\x8c"]="But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but the Father only."
BD["T3F\x8c"]="For just as you once disobeyed God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience,"
BD[")I6\x97"]="<b>presence</b><br> &emsp; Lit., face. In vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v33_12>12</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v33_17>17</a> Moses bargained with God for His presence to go with him and the people. God&rsquo;s presence is His way, the &ldquo;map&rdquo; that shows His people the way they should take (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v14_6>John 14:6</a> and <a href=JohN.htm#n14_6x1>note 1</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v11_8>Heb. 11:8</a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n11_8x1>note</a>). The children of Israel had God&rsquo;s presence in a very limited way, for they were far from God&rsquo;s heart (cf. <a href=Isa.htm#v29_13>Isa. 29:13</a>). Moses, however, was a person very near to God&rsquo;s heart and according to God&rsquo;s heart. Hence, he had God&rsquo;s presence to a full extent."
BD["O?O\x8c"]="For I say to you, You shall by no means see Me from now on until you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord."

BD["O\@H\x98"]="<b>fig</b><br> &emsp; The fig tree, signifying the nation of Israel, was cursed in <a href=Mat.htm#v21_19>21:19</a> (see <a href=MatN.htm#n21_19x1>notes</a> there). It passed through a long winter, from the first century A.D. to 1948, when Israel was restored as a nation. At that time its branch became tender and put forth its leaves. To the believers this fig tree is a sign of the end of this age."
BD["O>R\x8c"]="Saying, What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He? They said to Him, David&rsquo;s."
BD["U71\x8c"]="For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."

BD["U3=\x8c"]="For in your eating, each one takes his own supper first, and one is hungry and the other is drunk."

BD["U39\x98"]="<b>this</b><br> &emsp; From this verse to the end of the chapter the apostle dealt with the eighth problem, the problem concerning the Lord&rsquo;s supper."
BD["U1C\x8c"]="But I buffet my body and make <I>it</I> my slave, lest perhaps having preached to others, I myself may become disapproved."
BD["U2<\x98"]="<b>those</b><br> &emsp; See <a href=1CoN.htm#n10_18x1>note 18<sup>1</sup></a>. The eaters of things sacrificed to idols become not only those who fellowship with demons but also those who participate jointly in demons, making themselves one with demons."
