This forced Hannah to pray that the Lord would give her a male child. Hannah&rsquo;s prayer, in which she made a vow to God (vv. <a href=1Sa.htm#v1_10>10</a>-<a href=1Sa.htm#v1_11>11</a>), was initiated not by Hannah but by God. God was pleased with Hannah&rsquo;s prayer and her promise and He opened her womb. Hannah conceived, bore a child, and named him Samuel (<a href=1Sa.htm#v1_20>v. 20</a>).
