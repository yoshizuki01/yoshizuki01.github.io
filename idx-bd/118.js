BD["a3F\x97"]="<b>By</b><br> &emsp; Nothing is mentioned here regarding the forty years during which the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness, since they did nothing by faith there to please God, but rather provoked God by their unbelief during those years (<a href=Heb.htm#v3_16>3:16</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v3_18>18</a>). Even their crossing of the Jordan River is not mentioned here, because that crossing was due to the delay caused by their unbelief. That crossing would not have been needed if they had not had the unbelief that disqualified them from entering the good land at Kadesh-barnea (<a href=Deu.htm#v1_19>Deut. 1:19</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v1_46>46</a>) just a short time after they left Mount Sinai (<a href=Deu.htm#v1_2>Deut. 1:2</a>)."

But the heretical Cerinthians did not confess this; hence, they did not have God abiding in them, nor did they abide in God. Whoever confesses this, God abides in him and he in God. He becomes one with God in the divine life and nature."
