The great outpouring of the Spirit as the consummated Triune God will be upon those Jews who call upon the name of Jehovah and who thus are regenerated to become part of the church for the manifestation of Christ.

All the aforementioned items were fulfilled at the time of the Maccabees, and they will be much more fulfilled in glory at the time of restoration for the kingdom of God (<a href=Mat.htm#v19_28>Matt. 19:28</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v11_15>Rev. 11:15</a>).

The victory of the Maccabees was a type of the victory Israel will gain immediately before the age of restoration.<br> &emsp; The Minor Prophets, including Obadiah, reveal that the nations used by God to chastise sinful Israel do things in excess. Therefore, God will come in to judge the nations. This judgment will issue in Israel&rsquo;s gaining the victory and enlarging their territory for the kingdom of God on earth, especially for God&rsquo;s kingdom in the time of restoration.
