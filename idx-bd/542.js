Here, not Christ but the apostles and prophets who received the revelation concerning Christ are stressed as the foundation.

BD["X)?\x99"]="<b>fills</b><br> &emsp; Christ, who is the infinite God without any limitation, is so great that He fills all things in all things. Such a great Christ needs the church to be His fullness for His complete expression.<br> &emsp; In this chapter there are seven crucial things requiring the same basic factor for their accomplishment: God&rsquo;s selection that we should be made holy and without blemish (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_4>v. 4</a>); God&rsquo;s predestination that we may become His sons (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_5>v. 5</a>); the sealing of the Holy Spirit that we may be fully redeemed (vv. <a href=Eph.htm#v1_13>13</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_14>14</a>); the hope of God&rsquo;s calling; the glory of God&rsquo;s inheritance in the saints (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_18>v. 18</a>); God&rsquo;s power that causes us to participate in Christ&rsquo;s attainment (vv. <a href=Eph.htm#v1_19>19</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_22>22</a>); and the Body of Christ, the fullness of the all-filling Christ. All these are accomplished by the Triune God being dispensed and wrought into our being. The issue of such a divine dispensing into our humanity is the fullness of the One who fills all in all and the praise of God&rsquo;s expressed glory. Actually, this chapter is a revelation of God&rsquo;s marvelous and excellent economy, from His choosing of us in eternity to the producing of the Body of Christ to express Himself for eternity."

Hiram&rsquo;s father was the source of Hiram&rsquo;s skill in working with bronze. However, his father died, leaving his mother, the source of his existence, a widow. This signifies that in order to be useful to God for the building of the church, God&rsquo;s dwelling place, we need to acquire the secular learning and skills but must allow our &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father, the source of these things, to die. Furthermore, our &ldquo;Danite&rdquo; mother must be &ldquo;widowed&rdquo; (separated from the worldly source), and we must be of the &ldquo;tribe of Naphtali,&rdquo; the tribe of transformation. Thus, we continue to possess the learning and the skills without the source, our existence (mother) is no longer linked to our worldly origin, and we are in resurrection. Moses and the apostle Paul are excellent examples of this principle."

But when Christ was revealed to him by God (<a href=Gal.htm#v1_15>Gal. 1:15</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v1_16>16</a>), he saw that the excellency, the supereminence, the supreme preciousness, the surpassing worth, of Christ far exceeded the excellency of the law. His knowledge of Christ issued in the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. On account of this, he counted as loss not only the law and the religion founded according to the law, but all things."
