BD["i)4\x97"]="<b>turned</b><br> &emsp; To see anything requires the right position with the right angle. First, the apostle John heard the voice (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_10>v. 10</a>), and then, when he turned to see the voice, he saw the golden lampstands. He was rightly positioned, but he still needed the right angle to see the vision concerning the churches; so he turned. It is the same with us today. Many Christians need to be adjusted in their position and to be turned that they may see the vision of the churches."

BD["i*1\x97"]="<b>tribulation</b><br> &emsp; Tribulation is precious to the church because it tests the life of the church. The Lord&rsquo;s purpose in allowing the church to suffer tribulation is not only to testify that His resurrection life overcomes death but also to enable the church to enjoy the riches of His life."

BD["h)=\x97"]="<b>Keep</b><br> &emsp; We should keep ourselves in the love of God by building up ourselves upon our holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit (<a href=Jud.htm#v20>v. 20</a>); thus we await and look for the mercy of our Lord that we may not only enjoy eternal life in this age but also inherit it for eternity (<a href=Mat.htm#v19_29>Matt. 19:29</a>)."
BD["i,+\x97"]="<b>jasper</b><br> &emsp; According to <a href=Rev.htm#v21_11>21:11</a>, the jasper is &ldquo;a most precious stone&hellip;as clear as crystal.&rdquo; Its color must be dark green, which signifies life in its richness. Jasper here, as indicated in <a href=Rev.htm#v21_11>21:11</a>, signifies God&rsquo;s communicable glory in His rich life (<a href=Joh.htm#v17_22>John 17:22</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v17_2>2</a>). God&rsquo;s appearance is like jasper, as also the appearance of the holy city, New Jerusalem, will be (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_11>21:11</a>). The city&rsquo;s wall and first foundation are built with jasper (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_18>21:18</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_19>19</a>)."
BD["i*/\x9d"]="<b>Paradise</b><br> &emsp; The Paradise in <a href=Luk.htm#v23_43>Luke 23:43</a> is the pleasant and restful place where Abraham and all the dead saints are (<a href=Luk.htm#v16_23>Luke 16:23</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v16_26>26</a>). But the Paradise of God in this verse is the New Jerusalem (<a href=Rev.htm#v3_12>3:12</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>21:2</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_10>10</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>22:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v22_2>2</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_14>14</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_19>19</a>), of which the church is a foretaste today. We are enjoying the crucified and resurrected Christ as the tree of life, the food supply in our spirit, as a foretaste today in the church. This enjoyment of the foretaste will usher us into the full taste of the crucified and resurrected Christ as the tree of life, our nourishment of life in the New Jerusalem for eternity.<br> &emsp; Strictly, to eat of the tree of life&hellip;in the Paradise of God in this verse refers to the particular enjoyment of Christ as our life supply in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom, because this is a promise of reward made by the Lord to His overcomers. The enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the common portion of all God&rsquo;s redeemed people, whereas the particular enjoyment of Him as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom is a reward given only to the overcoming believers. If we overcome all the distractions in the church&rsquo;s degradation to enjoy Christ as the tree of life in the church today, we will be thus rewarded. Otherwise, we will miss this particular enjoyment in the coming kingdom, though we will still enjoy Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. The Lord&rsquo;s promises concerning the reward and the Lord&rsquo;s predictions concerning the loss, at the end of each of the seven epistles, refer to His dealing with His believers in the coming millennial kingdom. They have nothing to do with the believers&rsquo; eternal destiny&mdash;eternal salvation or eternal perdition."
