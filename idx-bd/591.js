BD["P,3\x97"]="<b>mystery</b><br> &emsp; God&rsquo;s economy concerning His kingdom was a hidden mystery, which has been unveiled to the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s disciples. Yet since the nature and character of the kingdom of God are wholly divine, and the elements through which it is brought forth are the divine life and the divine light (see notes <a href=MrkN.htm#n4_3x1>3<sup>1</sup></a>, <a href=MrkN.htm#n4_26x1>26<sup>1</sup></a>, and <a href=MrkN.htm#n4_21x1>21<sup>1</sup></a>), the kingdom of God, especially in its reality as the genuine church in this age (<a href=Rom.htm#v14_17>Rom. 14:17</a>), is still entirely a mystery to the natural man. Divine revelation is required to understand it."

Thus, they are well able to fulfill the new law of the kingdom and live in the kingdom&rsquo;s reality that they may enter into its manifestation."

Whereas <a href=Psa.htm#v1_3>Psa. 1:3</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v1_4>4</a> says that the law-keeper prospers and the wicked do not prosper, here the psalmist was puzzled (<a href=Psa.htm#v73_16>v. 16</a>) and nearly stumbled by his own suffering (vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v73_13>13</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v73_14>14</a>) and the prosperity of the wicked, who are at ease and heap up riches (<a href=Psa.htm#v73_12>v. 12</a>).

BD["APN\x97"]="<b>chamber</b><br> &emsp; This chamber, probably within the north gate of the inner court, was for the priests to wash the burnt offerings (<a href=Lev.htm#v1_3>Lev. 1:3</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v1_9>9</a>). This indicates that at this point in our experience, we are ready to be a burnt offering for God. When we pass through the gate to the inner court, we are in resurrection and on a higher level (see <a href=EzkN.htm#n40_31x1>note 31<sup>1</sup></a>). Here, we are not merely the common people in the outer court; we have become the priests who are ready to minister to the Lord by offering the burnt offering, meaning that we are ready to be absolute for the Lord (see <a href=LevN.htm#n1_3x1>note 3<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Lev.htm#v1>Lev. 1</a>)."

If they do not forgive man&rsquo;s offenses, neither will their heavenly Father forgive their offenses. In such a case, their prayer will be frustrated."

That was the first time Andrew and Peter had met the Lord. Here the Lord met them the second time, this time at the Sea of Galilee.
