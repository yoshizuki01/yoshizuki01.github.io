At Peter&rsquo;s conversion the Lord gave him a new name, Peter&mdash;a stone (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_42>John 1:42</a>); and when Peter received the revelation concerning Christ, the Lord revealed further that He was the rock&mdash;a stone (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_16>Matt. 16:16</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>18</a>). By these two incidents Peter received the impression that both Christ and His believers are stones for God&rsquo;s building."
