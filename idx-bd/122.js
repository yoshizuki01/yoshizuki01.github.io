BD[">Z)\x8c"]="Thus says Jehovah, / Where is the bill of your mother&rsquo;s divorce / With which I have put her away? / Or to which of My creditors / Have I sold you? / Indeed, for your iniquities you were sold, / And for your transgressions your mother was put away."

BD["()1\x97"]="<b>dry</b><br> &emsp; The appearing of the dry land is the sixth requirement for generating life. This took place on the third day, corresponding to the day of resurrection (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_4>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:4</a>). In the Bible the sea represents death and the land represents Christ (see <a href=DeuN.htm#n8_7x1>note 7<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Deu.htm#v8>Deut. 8</a>) as the generating source of life. After the land appeared, every kind of life&mdash;the plant life, the animal life, and even the human life&mdash;was produced out of the land (vv. <a href=Gen.htm#v1_11>11</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v1_12>12</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v1_24>24</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v1_27>27</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v2_7>2:7</a>). This typifies that the divine life with all its riches comes out of Christ. On the third day Christ came out of death in resurrection to generate life (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_24>John 12:24</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:3</a>) for the constituting of the church."
