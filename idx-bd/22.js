It explains the intention of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s forbidding, the Spirit of Jesus&rsquo; not allowing, and the coming of the vision in the night. To carry out this particular leading in the Lord&rsquo;s strategic move required the endeavoring of the apostle and his co-workers. This they did immediately."

Solomon&rsquo;s palaces were built with the same materials as those used for the temple. This indicates that his palaces were of the same rank as God&rsquo;s dwelling. God&rsquo;s dwelling was for God to be worshipped by His people. Solomon&rsquo;s palaces were for him to administrate his government over the people. Solomon&rsquo;s government was the governmental administration of God over His people (<a href=2Ch.htm#v9_8>2&nbsp;Chron. 9:8</a>).

The New Jerusalem will be the temple as God&rsquo;s dwelling place and the place in which the believers will live and serve God as priests, and also a palace in which God the Father as the King of kings and all His children as His co-kings will live and reign as kings (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_22>Rev. 21:22</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_3>22:3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>5</a>)."

BD["4))\x97"]="<b>Adam</b><br> &emsp; The books of 1 and 2&nbsp;Chronicles cover the genealogy of mankind from Adam to Abraham and of God&rsquo;s elect from Abraham to the family of Saul, and the history of Israel from Saul the king to Israel&rsquo;s return from their captivity. The central thought of these two books is as follows: First, they give us a full chronology of God&rsquo;s move in man&rsquo;s history by including the genealogy from Adam to Samuel (cf. the chronology in 1 and 2&nbsp;Samuel and 1 and 2&nbsp;Kings, which begins with Samuel). This chronology indicates that God&rsquo;s move in man&rsquo;s history to prepare the way for God to carry out His eternal economy in humanity is a matter that concerns not only the history of God&rsquo;s elect but also the history of the entire race of mankind (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_1>Matt. 1:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v1_17>17</a>; cf. <a href=Luk.htm#v3_23>Luke 3:23</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v3_38>38</a>). This is strong evidence that the Christ who was to come as the embodiment of God is not only for the one race chosen by God but for the entire human race created by God. Second, these books present to us some of the important details of God&rsquo;s dealing with the kings of Judah that are not recorded in 1 and 2&nbsp;Samuel and in 1 and 2&nbsp;Kings (see <a href=2ChN.htm#n11_5x1>note 5<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=2Ch.htm#v11>2&nbsp;Chron. 11</a>). Finally, they portray a complete history of God&rsquo;s move in man&rsquo;s history from Adam to Abraham, from Abraham to Samuel, and from Samuel, who brought in the kingship, to Israel&rsquo;s return from their captivity."
