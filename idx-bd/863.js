The tree of life, signifying God as life to man, must not be touched by sinful man. Thus, before the actual redemption was accomplished, God had to close the way to the tree of life. Once the actual redemption was completed to take away man&rsquo;s sin (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>John 1:29</a>) and terminate man&rsquo;s sinful nature (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_14>John 3:14</a> and <a href=JohN.htm#n3_14x1>note</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_3>Rom. 8:3</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n8_3x3>note 3</a>), access to the tree of life would again be possible (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_14>Rev. 22:14</a>)."
