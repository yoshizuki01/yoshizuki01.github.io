BD["a,0\x97"]="<b>Joshua</b><br> &emsp; Joshua, which means Jehovah the Savior or the salvation of Jehovah (<a href=Num.htm#v13_16>Num. 13:16</a>), is a Hebrew name, of which the equivalent in Greek is Jesus. Hence, Joshua was a type of the Lord Jesus, who brought the people of God into rest."
BD["a+3\x97"]="<b>They</b><br> &emsp; The Hebrew is idiomatic and conveys a strong negative. So also in <a href=Heb.htm#v4_3>4:3</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v4_5>5</a>."
BD["a*6\x97"]="<b>destroy</b><br> &emsp; Or, bring to nought, make of none effect, do away with, abolish, annul, discard. After the devil, the serpent, seduced man into the fall, God promised that the seed of woman would come to bruise the head of the serpent (<a href=Gen.htm#v3_15>Gen. 3:15</a>). In the fullness of the time the Son of God came to become flesh (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_3>Rom. 8:3</a>) by being born of a virgin (<a href=Gal.htm#v4_4>Gal. 4:4</a>), that He might destroy the devil in man&rsquo;s flesh through His death in the flesh on the cross. (See notes <a href=JohN.htm#n3_14x1>14<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Joh.htm#v3>John 3</a>, <a href=JohN.htm#n12_31x1>31<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Joh.htm#v12>John 12</a>, and <a href=RomN.htm#n8_3x3>3<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Rom.htm#v8>Rom. 8</a>.) This was to abolish Satan, to bring him to nought. Hallelujah, Satan has been abolished and done away with!"
BD[":\xa3*\x97"]="<b>gracious</b><br> &emsp; <a href=Psa.htm#v123>Psalm 123</a> is the praise of a saint, in his going up to Zion, concerning God&rsquo;s being gracious to the returned captives. It is not a matter of our loving God&rsquo;s law but of His being gracious to us."
BD["b*-\x97"]="<b>in</b><br> &emsp; Or, to; i.e., in the world&rsquo;s esteem."
BD["a.*\x97"]="<b>baptisms</b><br> &emsp; Baptisms, the same word in Greek as for washings in <a href=Heb.htm#v9_10>9:10</a> and dipping in <a href=Mrk.htm#v7_4>Mark 7:4</a>, refers to the washing of the utensils and vessels used for God&rsquo;s service in the tabernacle or temple (<a href=Lev.htm#v6_28>Lev. 6:28</a>) and also, probably, to the washing of the priests (<a href=Exo.htm#v30_18>Exo. 30:18</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v30_21>21</a>; <a href=Lev.htm#v16_4>Lev. 16:4</a>). This matter is, of course, related to the background of the Hebrew believers. However, it is the same in principle as the New Testament baptism&mdash;both are the washing away and terminating of the negative things."

BD["a--\x97"]="<b>glorify</b><br> &emsp; In this verse the word glorify replaces honor used in the foregoing verse. With the high priest taken from among men, there is only honor, a matter of position. With Christ as the High Priest, there is not only honor but also glory, not only the preciousness of His position but also the splendor of His person.
