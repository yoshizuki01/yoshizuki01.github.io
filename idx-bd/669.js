This was revealed in the case of Abraham and Sarah (<a href=Gen.htm#v17_15>Gen. 17:15</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v17_19>19</a>) and in the case of Hannah (<a href=1Sa.htm#v1_5>1&nbsp;Sam. 1:5</a>-<a href=1Sa.htm#v1_20>20</a>)."

BD[":r)\x97"]="<b>Why</b><br> &emsp; This psalm concerns the desolation of the house of God. After reaching the highest enjoyment of God in His house and His city at the end of Book Two, the psalmist lost this enjoyment, and God&rsquo;s house was desolated, as described in this psalm. Verses <a href=Psa.htm#v74_1>1</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v74_11>11</a> are the psalmist&rsquo;s painful presentation of the perpetual ruins and damage in the sanctuary of God (<a href=Psa.htm#v74_3>v. 3</a>). The temple, God&rsquo;s house, was desolated to such an extent that it was burned (vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v74_7>7</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v74_8>8</a>), and the city surrounding it was ruined (<a href=2Ch.htm#v36_19>2&nbsp;Chron. 36:19</a>). The intrinsic reason for the desolation was that Christ was not exalted by God&rsquo;s people; they did not give Him the preeminence, the first place, in everything (<a href=Jer.htm#v2_13>Jer. 2:13</a>; cf. <a href=Col.htm#v1_18>Col. 1:18</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v2_4>Rev. 2:4</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n2_4x2>note 2</a>). The problem of desolation is solved by Christ being properly appreciated and exalted by God&rsquo;s people (see <a href=PsaN.htm#n80_17x1>note 17<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Psa.htm#v80>Psa. 80</a>). The enjoyment of God in the house and the city of God can be maintained and preserved only when Christ is properly appreciated and exalted by God&rsquo;s people."

It is also an expression of self-humbling in seeking God&rsquo;s mercy. To give alms is to give what we have the right to possess, whereas to fast is to give up what we have the right to enjoy."

BD["R),\x97"]="<b>life</b><br> &emsp; Since <a href=Joh.htm#v1_3>v. 3</a> refers to the creation in <a href=Gen.htm#v1>Gen. 1</a>, life here should refer to the life signified by the tree of life in <a href=Gen.htm#v2>Gen. 2</a>. This is confirmed by the fact that in <a href=Rev.htm#v22>Rev. 22</a> John mentions the tree of life. Since life is in Him, He is life (<a href=Joh.htm#v11_25>11:25</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v14_6>14:6</a>), and He came that man might have life (<a href=Joh.htm#v10_10>10:10b</a>). The introduction to this Gospel is composed of this entire chapter; it begins with life (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_4>v. 4</a>) and ends with building (vv. <a href=Joh.htm#v1_42>42</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_51>51</a>), that is, with the house of God (see notes <a href=JohN.htm#n1_42x1>42<sup>1</sup></a>, <a href=JohN.htm#n1_51x2>51<sup>2</sup></a>, and <a href=JohN.htm#n1_51x3>51<sup>3</sup></a>).
