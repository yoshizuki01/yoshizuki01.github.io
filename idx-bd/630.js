BD["ATC\x97"]="<b>sin</b><br> &emsp; Whenever we draw near to God, we need to offer the sin offering, applying the Lord&rsquo;s redemption and receiving the cleansing of His precious blood. See <a href=ExoN.htm#n29_36x1>note 36<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v29>Exo. 29</a>."

BD["O1.\x97"]="<b>authority</b><br> &emsp; To forgive sins is a matter of having authority on earth. Only this kingly Savior, who had been authorized by God and who would die to redeem sinners, had such authority (<a href=Act.htm#v5_31>Acts 5:31</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v10_43>10:43</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v13_38>13:38</a>). This authority was for the establishing of the kingdom of the heavens (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_19>16:19</a>)."
BD["O01\x97"]="<b>authority</b><br> &emsp; The centurion, a Gentile, recognized the authority of the kingly Savior and realized that His word had the authority to heal. Thus, he believed not only in the kingly Savior but also in His word, asking Him not to go in person but only to speak the word. This was stronger faith, and it was marveled at by the Savior (<a href=Mat.htm#v8_10>v. 10</a>)."

To preach (<a href=Mrk.htm#v1_14>v. 14</a>) the gospel was to minister God to people; to cast out demons was to keep Satan away from people. These constituted the main purpose of the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s gospel service."

BD["APO\x97"]="<b>tables</b><br> &emsp; The eight tables within the north gate are for slaying the offerings (vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v40_39>39</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v40_43>43</a>). They are divided into two groups of four (<a href=Ezk.htm#v40_41>v. 41</a>). They are one and a half cubits square and one cubit high (<a href=Ezk.htm#v40_42>v. 42</a>). The number one signifies the unique God. The number three, the sum of the one and a half cubits of length and the one and a half cubits of breadth, signifies the Triune God in resurrection. The Triune God has been &ldquo;split,&rdquo; as indicated by the tables on the two sides of the gate as well as by the width of each table measuring half of three cubits. Thus, the numbers related to the eight tables signify that the Triune God (three), the unique God (one), who became a creature (four), was &ldquo;split&rdquo; on the cross, yet He was resurrected (eight). Now in resurrection He is a testimony (two). Today our service, our ministry, must be in the Triune God, the unique God, who was &ldquo;split&rdquo; as a creature and is now in resurrection as a living testimony."
BD["P)=\x97"]="<b>synagogue</b><br> &emsp; A synagogue is a meeting place where the Jews read and learn the Holy Scriptures (<a href=Luk.htm#v4_16>Luke 4:16</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v4_17>17</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v13_14>Acts 13:14</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v13_15>15</a>)."
BD[":p.\x97"]="<b>drop</b><br> &emsp; In His second coming Christ will gain the earth not mainly by exercising His righteous judgment but by coming like showers to water the people of the earth. He will have mercy on the earth and will come back graciously like showers of rain to satisfy the thirsty ones (cf. <a href=Rev.htm#v22_17>Rev. 22:17</a>). In that day all the nations will be rained on by Christ and will be happy under His dominion."
BD["O-:\x97"]="<b>heaven</b><br> &emsp; After the millennial kingdom the old heaven and old earth will pass away when the new heaven and new earth come in (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_1>Rev. 21:1</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v1_11>Heb. 1:11</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v1_12>12</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_10>2&nbsp;Pet. 3:10</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_13>13</a>). What is covered by the law extends only to the end of the millennial kingdom, whereas what is covered by the prophets extends to the new heaven and new earth (<a href=Isa.htm#v65_17>Isa. 65:17</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v66_22>66:22</a>). This is why both the law and the prophets are referred to in <a href=Mat.htm#v5_17>v. 17</a>, but only the law, not the prophets, is mentioned in <a href=Mat.htm#v5_18>v. 18</a>."
BD["M61\x97"]="<b>King</b><br> &emsp; In the millennium Jehovah as Christ will be King over all the earth (<a href=Zec.htm#v9_10>9:10b</a>; <a href=Psa.htm#v72_8>Psa. 72:8</a>), and He will be the one God and His name the one name."
BD["O,=\x97"]="<b>mending</b><br> &emsp; When James and John were called by the Lord, they were in a boat, mending their nets. Eventually, John became a real mender, mending the rents in the church by his ministry of life. (See his three Epistles and chs. <a href=Mat.htm#v2>2</a> and <a href=Mat.htm#v3>3</a> of Revelation.)"
BD["AW:\x97"]="<b>eastern</b><br> &emsp; I.e., the Dead Sea. The good land is situated between the waters of the Mediterranean Sea on the west (<a href=Ezk.htm#v47_15>v. 15</a>) and the waters of the Dead Sea and the Jordan River on the east. For the land of Canaan, an elevated land (<a href=Ezk.htm#v20_40>20:40</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v20_42>42</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v34_13>34:13</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v34_14>14</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v37_22>37:22</a>; <a href=Deu.htm#v32_13>Deut. 32:13</a>), to be surrounded by water indicates that it is surrounded by death. Thus, the good land typifies the resurrected Christ, who was raised, elevated, from the dead (cf. <a href=Gen.htm#v1_9>Gen. 1:9</a>). See <a href=NumN.htm#n34_12x1>note 12<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Num.htm#v34>Num. 34</a>.<br> &emsp; On the north side of the good land there is no river as a border; instead, there is Mount Hermon, a high mountain, which signifies the heavens, from which the dew descends (<a href=Psa.htm#v133_3>Psa. 133:3</a>). The elevated good land with Mount Hermon signifies the resurrected Christ, who has ascended to the heavens."
BD[":l:\x97"]="<b>ascended</b><br> &emsp; Referring to Christ&rsquo;s ascension to the third heaven, the highest peak in the universe (cf. <a href=Isa.htm#v14_13>Isa. 14:13</a>). See <a href=EphN.htm#n4_8x1>note 8<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Eph.htm#v4>Eph. 4</a>. Paul&rsquo;s quoting of this verse in <a href=Eph.htm#v4>Eph. 4</a> in reference to the building up of the church is a strong proof that the building up of the temple in the ancient times is a type of the building of the church. It also provides a strong basis to say that the temple, the house, and the city referred to in the Psalms typify the church."
BD["AV=\x97"]="<b>court</b><br> &emsp; The four enclosed courts at the four corners of the outer court are the boiling houses for the sacrifices of the people (vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v46_21>21</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v46_24>24</a>). This indicates that, by God&rsquo;s grace, the preparation of Christ for others&rsquo; enjoyment is spreading to every corner, making Christ available everywhere. The measurement of the corner chambers is forty by thirty (<a href=Ezk.htm#v46_22>v. 22</a>). The number forty signifies trials and testing (<a href=Mat.htm#v4_1>Matt. 4:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v4_2>2</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v3_9>Heb. 3:9</a>) and indicates here that apart from the Lord&rsquo;s suffering, testing, and trials, He could not have been &ldquo;cooked,&rdquo; prepared for our enjoyment."
