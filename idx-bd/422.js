BD["P)7\x99"]="<b>believe</b><br> &emsp; Repentance is mainly in the mind; believing is mainly in the heart (<a href=Rom.htm#v10_9>Rom. 10:9</a>). To believe in is to believe into the things in which we believe and to receive into us the things in which we believe. To believe in the gospel is mainly to believe in the Slave-Savior (<a href=Act.htm#v16_31>Acts 16:31</a>), and to believe in Him is to believe into Him (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_15>John 3:15</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_16>16</a>) and to receive Him into us (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_12>John 1:12</a>) that we may be organically united with Him. Such a faith in Christ (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_22>Gal. 3:22</a>) is given to us by God through our hearing of the word of the truth of the gospel (<a href=Rom.htm#v10_17>Rom. 10:17</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v1_13>Eph. 1:13</a>). This faith brings us into all the blessings of the gospel (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_14>Gal. 3:14</a>). Hence, it is precious to us (<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_1>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:1</a>). Such a precious faith must be preceded by repentance. See <a href=MrkN.htm#n16_16x1>note 16<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mrk.htm#v16>ch. 16</a>."
