BD["=+,\x97"]="<b>mother</b><br> &emsp; After finding her Beloved, she holds Him and will not let go until she brings Him into the Spirit of grace, through which she was regenerated (her mother&rsquo;s house and chamber), for secret fellowship. She was born in the mother&rsquo;s house and was conceived in the mother&rsquo;s chamber. The mother is grace (<a href=Gal.htm#v4_26>Gal. 4:26</a>, <a href=Gal.htm#v4_31>31</a> and <a href=GalN.htm#n4_31x1>note 31<sup>1</sup></a>), and the mother&rsquo;s chamber signifies love, which is of the Father and which issues in grace (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_4>Eph. 2:4</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_5>5</a>). The Spirit brings God&rsquo;s love and carries God&rsquo;s grace to us (<a href=2Co.htm#v13_14>2&nbsp;Cor. 13:14</a> and <a href=2CoN.htm#n13_14x1P1>note 1, pars. 1</a> and <a href=2CoN.htm#n13_14x1P2>2</a>); hence, He is called the Spirit of grace (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_29>Heb. 10:29</a>).

BD[">))\x97"]="<b>Isaiah</b><br> &emsp; Meaning the salvation of Jah. The book of Isaiah, in its content concerning God&rsquo;s eternal economy in Christ, is the leading book among all the books of the prophets. This book is the vision that Isaiah saw (<a href=Isa.htm#v1_1>v. 1</a>), the word that Isaiah saw (<a href=Isa.htm#v2_1>2:1</a>), and the burden that Isaiah saw (<a href=Isa.htm#v13_1>13:1</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v15_1>15:1</a>). The vision, word, and burden in Isaiah are concerned with God&rsquo;s eternal economy in Christ, which is thoroughly covered in this book.<br> &emsp; The book of Isaiah unveils that God&rsquo;s dealing in love with His beloved Israel and His righteous judgment upon the nations bring in Christ, the Savior (<a href=Isa.htm#v43_3>43:3</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v49_26>49:26</a>), who is God (<a href=Isa.htm#v9_6>9:6</a>) incarnated to be a man (<a href=Isa.htm#v7_14>7:14</a>), possessing both the divine nature and the human nature (<a href=Isa.htm#v4_2>4:2</a>), living on this earth (<a href=Isa.htm#v53_2>53:2</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v53_3>3</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v42_1>42:1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v42_4>4</a>), crucified (<a href=Isa.htm#v53_7>53:7</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v53_10>10a</a>, <a href=Isa.htm#v53_12>12</a>), resurrected (<a href=Isa.htm#v53_10>53:10b</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v53_11>11</a>), ascended (<a href=Isa.htm#v52_13>52:13</a>), and coming (<a href=Isa.htm#v40_10>40:10</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v64_1>64:1</a>) to meet the need of God&rsquo;s chosen people and the nations (<a href=Isa.htm#v9_1>9:1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v9_7>7</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v49_6>49:6</a>) in God&rsquo;s all-inclusive salvation (<a href=Isa.htm#v12_2>12:2</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v12_3>3</a>), that the restoration of all things, of the created yet fallen universe (<a href=Isa.htm#v2_2>2:2</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v2_5>5</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v11_6>11:6</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v11_9>9</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v35_1>35:1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v35_10>10</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v30_26>30:26</a>), may be brought in, which will consummate in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (<a href=Isa.htm#v65_17>65:17</a>). Hence, the content of Isaiah covers God&rsquo;s entire economy of the New Testament, from the incarnation (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_18>Matt. 1:18</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v1_25>25</a>) to the new heaven and new earth (<a href=Rev.htm#v21>Rev. 21</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v22>22</a>), with the Old Testament background of God&rsquo;s dealing with Israel and His judgment upon the nations. According to Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy, the Christ who was processed for the divine purposes is the centrality and universality of the great wheel of the move of the Divine Trinity (<a href=Ezk.htm#v1_15>Ezek. 1:15</a> and <a href=EzkN.htm#n1_15x1>note 1</a>) for the accomplishing of His economy in the divine dispensing of Himself into His elect."

Righteousness issues in peace (<a href=Isa.htm#v32_17>Isa. 32:17</a>). As the King of peace (<a href=Isa.htm#v9_6>Isa. 9:6</a>), Christ, through righteousness, brings in peace between God and us, and in such a peace He fulfills the ministry of His priesthood.
