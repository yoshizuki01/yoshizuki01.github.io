BD["a3P\x98"]="<b>better</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means superior, nobler, greater; hence, better. It is used thirteen times in this book: the better Christ (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_4>1:4</a>), better things (<a href=Heb.htm#v6_9>6:9</a>), a better hope (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_19>7:19</a>), a better covenant (twice&mdash;<a href=Heb.htm#v7_22>7:22</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v8_6>8:6</a>), better promises (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_6>8:6</a>), better sacrifices (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_23>9:23</a>), a better possession (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_34>10:34</a>), a better country (<a href=Heb.htm#v11_16>11:16</a>), a better resurrection (<a href=Heb.htm#v11_35>11:35</a>), something better (<a href=Heb.htm#v11_40>11:40</a>), and better speaking (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_24>12:24</a>). (The other instance is in <a href=Heb.htm#v7_7>7:7</a>, where it is translated greater.) All these better things are the fulfillment and reality of the things that the Old Testament saints had in types, figures, and shadows. What God provided at that time was a picture of the things concerning us, the things that were to come in the new covenant and that are the true and real things, better, stronger, more powerful, nobler, and greater than their types, figures, and shadows. The Old Testament saints, who had only the shadows, need us for their perfection that they may share with us in the real things of the new covenant. Why, then, should we leave the real things of the new covenant and turn to the shadows of the old covenant?"

But Israel needed to wait on Him until the time of restoration (<a href=Mat.htm#v19_28>Matt. 19:28</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v3_21>Acts 3:21</a>), when He will restore the children of Israel to be in His person and in His eternal kingdom to enjoy what He had promised to their forefathers. See <a href=LamN.htm#n3_25x1>note 25<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Lam.htm#v3>ch. 3</a>.<br> &emsp; In vv. <a href=Lam.htm#v5_20>20</a>-<a href=Lam.htm#v5_22>22</a> Jeremiah speaks to Jehovah a challenging word, even a commanding and reproving word. However, Jehovah did not answer him but remained silent. All Jeremiah&rsquo;s challenges and questions are answered in the following books of the Bible. The consummation of this answer will be the New Jerusalem. Hence, Jeremiah must wait until the New Testament age, until the age of the millennial kingdom, and until the New Jerusalem. Then he will be fully satisfied."

Satan&rsquo;s heart was lifted up because of his beauty, and he corrupted his wisdom by reason of his brightness (<a href=Ezk.htm#v28_17>Ezek. 28:17</a>). In his arrogance Satan declared five times, &ldquo;I will&hellip;,&rdquo; indicating that his intention in his rebellion was to overthrow God&rsquo;s authority and to exalt himself to be equal with God. Satan&rsquo;s ambition for position became the motivation of all the rebellions recorded in the Scriptures (<a href=Gen.htm#v11_4>Gen. 11:4</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v12_1>Num. 12:1</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v12_2>2</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v16_1>16:1</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v16_3>3</a>; <a href=2Sa.htm#v15_10>2&nbsp;Sam. 15:10</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v15_12>12</a>; etc.).
