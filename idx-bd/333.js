The eternal Spirit is the power, the strength, the efficacy, of Christ&rsquo;s redemption. The function of the rings was twofold: (1) to bear the weight of the grating, on which the wood and the sacrifices were burned, and (2) to provide a way for the altar to move (<a href=Exo.htm#v38_5>38:5</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v38_7>7</a>). The fire on the altar came from God (<a href=Lev.htm#v9_24>Lev. 9:24</a>; cf. <a href=2Ch.htm#v7_1>2&nbsp;Chron. 7:1</a>) and never ceased (<a href=Lev.htm#v6_13>Lev. 6:13</a>); while the altar was moving, the fire was burning continually. Both the burning and the moving depended on the four rings. This signifies that it is the eternal Spirit who makes Christ&rsquo;s redemption effective and who is the power for the move of the cross of Christ to the four corners of the earth (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_18>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:18</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v1_16>Rom. 1:16</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v15_18>15:18</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v15_19>19</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v1_8>Acts 1:8</a>; <a href=1Th.htm#v1_5>1&nbsp;Thes. 1:5</a>). The rings being of the same material as the grating and forming one piece with the grating indicates that the life-giving Spirit is the issue of the redeeming Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>) and of His redemption (<a href=Act.htm#v2_38>Acts 2:38</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v3_13>Gal. 3:13</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v3_14>14</a>) and identifies Christ with the Spirit (<a href=2Co.htm#v3_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:17</a>).
