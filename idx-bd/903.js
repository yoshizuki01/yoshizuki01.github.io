As the Lamb of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>John 1:29</a>), He had to be offered to God at Mount Moriah, where Abraham offered Isaac and enjoyed God&rsquo;s provision of a ram as a substitute for his son (<a href=Gen.htm#v22_2>Gen. 22:2</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v22_9>9</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v22_14>14</a>) and where the temple was built in Jerusalem (<a href=2Ch.htm#v3_1>2&nbsp;Chron. 3:1</a>). It had to be there that He would be delivered, according to the counsel determined by the Trinity of the Godhead (<a href=Act.htm#v2_23>Acts 2:23</a>), to the Jewish leaders (<a href=Mrk.htm#v9_31>9:31</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v10_33>10:33</a>) and be rejected by them as the builders of God&rsquo;s building (<a href=Mrk.htm#v8_31>8:31</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v4_11>Acts 4:11</a>). It had to be there that He would be crucified according to the Roman form of capital punishment (<a href=Joh.htm#v18_31>John 18:31</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v18_32>32</a> and <a href=JohN.htm#n18_32x1>note</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v19_6>19:6</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v19_14>14</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v19_15>15</a>) to fulfill the type concerning the kind of death He would die (<a href=Num.htm#v21_8>Num. 21:8</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v21_9>9</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_14>John 3:14</a>). Moreover, according to Daniel&rsquo;s prophecy (<a href=Dan.htm#v9_24>Dan. 9:24</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v9_26>26</a>), that very year was the year that Messiah (Christ) was to be cut off (killed). Furthermore, as the Passover lamb (<a href=1Co.htm#v5_7>1&nbsp;Cor. 5:7</a>), He had to be killed in the month of the Passover (<a href=Exo.htm#v12_1>Exo. 12:1</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v12_11>11</a>). Hence, He had to go to Jerusalem (<a href=Mrk.htm#v10_33>v. 33</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v11_1>11:1</a>, <a href=Mrk.htm#v11_11>11</a>, <a href=Mrk.htm#v11_15>15</a>, <a href=Mrk.htm#v11_27>27</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v12_12>John 12:12</a>) before the Passover (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_1>John 12:1</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v14_1>Mark 14:1</a>) that He might die there on the day of the Passover (<a href=Mrk.htm#v14_12>14:12</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v14_17>17</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v18_28>John 18:28</a>) at the place and the time foreordained by God."

The house signifies the house of Israel (<a href=Mat.htm#v10_6>10:6</a>), and the sea signifies the Gentile world (<a href=Dan.htm#v7_3>Dan. 7:3</a>, <a href=Dan.htm#v7_17>17</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v17_15>Rev. 17:15</a>). The King&rsquo;s going out of the house to sit beside the sea signifies that after His break with the Jews, He forsook the house of Israel and turned to the Gentiles. It was after this, while on the seashore, that He gave the parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom. This signifies that the mysteries of the kingdom were revealed in the church.

BD["O08\x97"]="<b>many</b><br> &emsp; Many who were demon-possessed and all those who were ill represent all the people on earth in the millennium. The millennium is the last dispensation of the old heaven and old earth; thus, it is considered the &ldquo;evening&rdquo; of the old heaven and old earth. In the millennium the power to cast out demons and heal illnesses will be manifested to the uttermost. Hence, all the demon-possessed and all the sick will be healed. Such extensive power is the power of the coming age (<a href=Heb.htm#v6_5>Heb. 6:5</a>). The casting out of demons and the healing of the sick in this age are only a foretaste of the extensive power of the coming age.

In Mark&rsquo;s record, which shows that Jesus is the Servant of God, the order is according to history. In Matthew&rsquo;s record, which proves that Christ is the King of the kingdom of the heavens, the order is according to doctrine; i.e., Matthew puts certain incidents together to present a doctrine. In Luke&rsquo;s record, which reveals that Jesus is the proper man to be man&rsquo;s Savior, the order is according to morality.
