BD["O).\x99"]="<b>Solomon</b><br> &emsp; When David committed murder and adultery, he was rebuked by the prophet Nathan, whom God had sent purposely to condemn him (<a href=2Sa.htm#v12_1>2&nbsp;Sam. 12:1</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v12_12>12</a>). When David was condemned, he repented. <a href=Psa.htm#v51>Psalm 51</a> is the record of his repentance. He repented and God forgave him (<a href=2Sa.htm#v12_13>2&nbsp;Sam. 12:13</a>). Then he begot Solomon (<a href=2Sa.htm#v12_24>2&nbsp;Sam. 12:24</a>). Hence, Solomon is the issue of man&rsquo;s transgression and repentance plus God&rsquo;s forgiveness.<br> &emsp; The genealogy in Matthew says that David begot Solomon, but the genealogy in Luke says that Nathan was the son of David (<a href=Luk.htm#v3_31>Luke 3:31</a>). <a href=1Ch.htm#v3_5>First Chronicles 3:5</a> tells us that Nathan and Solomon were two different persons. Luke&rsquo;s record is the genealogy of David&rsquo;s son Nathan, who was Mary&rsquo;s forefather, whereas Matthew&rsquo;s record is the genealogy of David&rsquo;s son Solomon, who was Joseph&rsquo;s forefather. One genealogy is the line of Mary, the line of the wife; the other is the line of Joseph, the line of the husband. Both Mary and Joseph were descendants of David. Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty they were joined together by marriage, so that through Mary, Joseph was indirectly associated with Christ. Christ can be counted as a descendant of David through either Solomon or Nathan. Hence, He has two genealogies.<br> &emsp; Strictly, Solomon was not a direct forefather of Christ. His relationship with Christ was indirect, through the marriage of Joseph, his descendant, to Mary, of whom Christ was born (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_16>v. 16</a>). The Old Testament did not say that Christ would be Solomon&rsquo;s descendant, but it prophesied repeatedly that Christ would be a descendant of David (<a href=2Sa.htm#v7_13>2&nbsp;Sam. 7:13</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v7_14>14</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v23_5>Jer. 23:5</a>). Although Christ was not a direct descendant of Solomon, the Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ as a descendant of David were nevertheless fulfilled."
