Christ&rsquo;s becoming the firstborn Son through His death and resurrection (<a href=Rom.htm#v1_3>Rom. 1:3</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v1_4>4</a>) is for us to become sons of God as heirs to inherit all the riches of what God is, that is, to receive, participate in, and enjoy all the riches of the Triune God (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_14>Rom. 8:14</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_17>17</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v3_26>Gal. 3:26</a>, <a href=Gal.htm#v3_29>29</a>).

The priests, who were such by birth, were ordained by God out of His initiation, whereas the Nazarite, who became such by a vow, was separated to God by himself out of his initiation. God&rsquo;s ordaining of one family (Aaron&rsquo;s) to be the priests excluded all others from this opportunity. But the vow of the Nazarite opens the gate, affording all the people of God an equal opportunity to be absolutely for God as a warrior (<a href=Jdg.htm#v13_5>Judg. 13:5</a>) or as a priest (<a href=1Sa.htm#v1_11>1&nbsp;Sam. 1:11</a>; <a href=1Sa.htm#v2_11>2:11</a>). Whoever is willing may take this opportunity on his own initiative. The accomplishing of God&rsquo;s purpose requires man&rsquo;s cooperation to complement God&rsquo;s ordination, as illustrated by the case of Samuel, who as a Nazarite fulfilled the duty of a priest, complementing the deficient Eli, a priest ordained by God (<a href=1Sa.htm#v1>1&nbsp;Sam. 1</a>&mdash;<a href=1Sa.htm#v3>3</a>)."
