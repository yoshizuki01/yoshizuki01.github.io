BD["b*\@\x97"]="<b>justified</b><br> &emsp; To be justified by faith is for the receiving of the divine life (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_18>Rom. 5:18</a>); to be justified by works is through living the divine life. Since the living is the issue of life, to be justified by works is the issue of being justified by faith. Abraham&rsquo;s offering of Isaac and Rahab&rsquo;s receiving of the messengers and sending them out are works that issued from their living faith. A living tree surely brings forth fruit. Being justified by works is not inconsistent with being justified by faith. The latter is the cause, bringing forth the former; the former is the effect, the outcome and proof, of the latter.<br> &emsp; This chapter begins with the matter of having no respect of persons (vv. <a href=Jam.htm#v2_1>1</a>-<a href=Jam.htm#v2_13>13</a>) and arrives at the practical care for the necessities of the poor saints, which is the justifying work of faith (vv. <a href=Jam.htm#v2_14>14</a>-<a href=Jam.htm#v2_26>26</a>). These virtues, according to James&rsquo;s view, can be considered characteristics of practical Christian perfection."

BD["b)C\x97"]="<b>orphans</b><br> &emsp; In this word of James&rsquo;s, given to strengthen his view of practical Christian perfection, an element of the Old Testament charges is implied (<a href=Deu.htm#v14_29>Deut. 14:29</a>; <a href=Deu.htm#v24_19>24:19</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v24_21>21</a>, <a href=Deu.htm#v24_12>12</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v24_13>13</a>)."

BD["d)0\x9a"]="<b>constitute</b><br> &emsp; This indicates that the virtues of the divine life and divine nature are the constituents of our spiritual constitution, our spiritual being, making us persons who do not have the elements of idleness and unfruitfulness."
BD["c-.\x97"]="<b>humbled</b><br> &emsp; In Greek the word is in the passive voice, indicating being made humble by God, mainly through sufferings in persecution (<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_10>v. 10</a>). This, however, requires that we cooperate with God&rsquo;s operation; we must be willing to be made humble, lowly, under the mighty hand of God. Hence, be humbled. Humbled is passive, but be is active. While God is acting to operate on us, we need to take the initiative to be operated on by Him. To take the initiative is active; to be operated on is passive. This is our willingness to be under the hand of God, which is mighty to do everything for us."

BD["a4*\x9a"]="<b>Perfecter</b><br> &emsp; Or, Finisher, Completer. Jesus is also the Finisher, the Completer, of faith. He will finish what He originated. He will complete what He inaugurated. If we look to Him continually, He will finish and complete the faith that we need for the running of the heavenly race."

BD["c)9\x9a"]="<b>fear</b><br> &emsp; A holy fear, as in <a href=Phi.htm#v2_12>Phil. 2:12</a>; i.e., a healthy, serious caution that leads us to behave holily. Such fear is mentioned a number of times in this book (see <a href=1PeN.htm#n1_17xe>reference 17<sup>e</sup></a>) because this book&rsquo;s teaching concerns the government of God."
BD["a21\x97"]="<b>first</b><br> &emsp; The first here refers to the sacrifices of the first covenant, the old covenant; the second refers to the sacrifice of the second covenant, the new covenant, which sacrifice is Christ. Christ came into the world that He might, according to the will of God, put away the animal sacrifices of the old covenant and establish Himself as the sacrifice of the new covenant."

BD["b-7\x97"]="<b>prayer</b><br> &emsp; Not the usual form of the word for prayer. It is translated vow in <a href=Act.htm#v18_18>Acts 18:18</a> and <a href=Act.htm#v21_23>21:23</a>."
BD["b-6\x9a"]="<b>in</b><br> &emsp; In the name of the Lord signifies oneness with the Lord. The elders do not do the anointing alone; rather, by being one with the Lord, they represent both the Body and the Head to do the anointing."
BD["a14\x97"]="<b>obtaining</b><br> &emsp; Christ accomplished redemption on the cross (<a href=Col.htm#v1_20>Col. 1:20</a>), but it was not until He entered into the heavenly Holy of Holies through the redeeming blood, i.e., when He brought His redeeming blood to offer it before God, that He obtained the redemption that has an eternal effect."
BD["a/:\x97"]="<b>setting</b><br> &emsp; The commandment, or the regulations, of the law concerning the Levitical priesthood was set aside because it was merely in letters and thus was weak. It was not a matter of life but was a dead commandment in letters; thus, it was unprofitable."
