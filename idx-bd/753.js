BD["a1)\x97"]="<b>sanctuary</b><br> &emsp; The same Greek word as for holy places in <a href=Heb.htm#v8_2>8:2</a>. Here, however, it is singular and, hence, is rendered sanctuary. The sanctuary is the entire tabernacle (<a href=Exo.htm#v25_8>Exo. 25:8</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v25_9>9</a>), including the first tabernacle, which is called the Holy Place (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_2>v. 2</a>), and the second tabernacle, which is called the Holy of Holies (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_3>v. 3</a>).

BD["a,8\x97"]="<b>throne</b><br> &emsp; Undoubtedly, the throne mentioned here is the throne of God, which is in heaven (<a href=Rev.htm#v4_2>Rev. 4:2</a>). The throne of God is the throne of authority toward all the universe (<a href=Dan.htm#v7_9>Dan. 7:9</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v5_1>Rev. 5:1</a>). But toward us, the believers, it becomes the throne of grace, signified by the expiation cover (the mercy seat) within the Holy of Holies (<a href=Exo.htm#v25_17>Exo. 25:17</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v25_21>21</a>). This throne is the throne of both God and the Lamb (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>Rev. 22:1</a>). How can we come to the throne of God and the Lamb, Christ, in heaven while we still live on earth? The secret is our spirit, referred to in <a href=Heb.htm#v4_12>v. 12</a>. The very Christ who is sitting on the throne in heaven (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_34>Rom. 8:34</a>) is also now in us (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_10>Rom. 8:10</a>), that is, in our spirit (<a href=2Ti.htm#v4_22>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:22</a>), where the habitation of God is (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>Eph. 2:22</a>). At Bethel, the house of God, the habitation of God, which is the gate of heaven, Christ is the ladder that joins earth to heaven and brings heaven to earth (<a href=Gen.htm#v28_12>Gen. 28:12</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v28_17>17</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_51>John 1:51</a>). Since today our spirit is the place of God&rsquo;s habitation, it is now the gate of heaven, where Christ is the ladder that joins us, the people on earth, to heaven, and brings heaven to us. Hence, whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter through the gate of heaven and touch the throne of grace in heaven through Christ as the heavenly ladder."

BD["c*,\x97"]="<b>living</b><br> &emsp; A living stone is one that not only possesses life but also grows in life. This is Christ for God&rsquo;s building. Here Peter changed his metaphor from a seed, which is of the vegetable life (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_23>1:23</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_24>24</a>), to a stone, which is of the minerals. The seed is for life-planting; the stone is for building (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>v. 5</a>). Peter&rsquo;s thought went on from life-planting to God&rsquo;s building. As life to us, Christ is the seed; for God&rsquo;s building, He is the stone. After receiving Him as the seed of life, we need to grow that we may experience Him as the stone living in us. Thus He will make us also living stones, transformed with His stone nature, that we may be built together with others as a spiritual house upon Him as both the foundation and the cornerstone (<a href=Isa.htm#v28_16>Isa. 28:16</a>)."

BD["c)/\x97"]="<b>proving</b><br> &emsp; I.e., testing for approval. It is the trying, the proving, of faith, not the faith itself, that may be found unto praise. (This is like the school&rsquo;s examination of the student&rsquo;s studying: what is found to be approved is the examination, not the student&rsquo;s studying itself.) Of course, the approval of faith comes out of the proper faith. The stress here is not on faith but on the proving of faith by trials that come through sufferings."
