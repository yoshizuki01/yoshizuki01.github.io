While she commits her fornication, she is furious with the saints who do not consent to her fornication. This is the fury of her fornication. Hence, the wine of her fornication is also called &ldquo;the wine of the fury of her fornication.&rdquo;"

This one may be Judas Iscariot (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_70>John 6:70</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v6_71>71</a>), because after Judas died, he went to &ldquo;his own place&rdquo; (<a href=Act.htm#v1_25>Acts 1:25</a>), not to his people as others did (<a href=Gen.htm#v25_17>Gen. 25:17</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v35_29>35:29</a>).

BD["G,3\x97"]="<b>pity</b><br> &emsp; This book indicates particularly that God is not the God only of a certain people; He is the God of all peoples (<a href=Rom.htm#v3_29>Rom. 3:29</a>). The Jews thought that they were the unique people of God. They considered themselves the firstborn son with the right to be the first to enjoy all that is of God (<a href=Exo.htm#v4_22>Exo. 4:22</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v15_11>Luke 15:11</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v15_32>32</a>). But because the Jews responded to God wrongly, the Gentiles, not the Jews, became the first to enjoy God in His salvation (<a href=Mat.htm#v21_28>Matt. 21:28</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v21_32>32</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v13_45>Acts 13:45</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v13_48>48</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v11_11>Rom. 11:11</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v11_17>17</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v11_25>25</a>).<br> &emsp; The book of Jonah indicates that while God was angry with Assyria, He would still be gracious and compassionate toward a great and sinful city such as Nineveh. This indicates that God&rsquo;s economy is to do things through Israel, His suffering people, and the nations, the consuming &ldquo;locusts&rdquo; (<a href=Joe.htm#v1_4>Joel 1:4</a> and <a href=JoeN.htm#n1_4x1>note</a>), to extend His salvation to all the peoples on earth (<a href=Mat.htm#v28_19>Matt. 28:19</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v1_8>Acts 1:8</a>)."
