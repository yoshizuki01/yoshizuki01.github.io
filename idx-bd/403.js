BD["b-<\x99"]="<b>death</b><br> &emsp; Not eternal perdition but dispensational discipline by physical death (see <a href=1JoN.htm#n5_16x5>note 16<sup>5</sup></a> in <a href=1Jo.htm#v5>1&nbsp;John 5</a>). From death here should equal raise&hellip;up in <a href=Jam.htm#v5_15>v. 15</a>."
BD["97F\x8c"]="He will not go away from darkness; / The flame will dry up his shoots, / And by the breath of His mouth he will go away."
BD["e)-\x99"]="<b>light</b><br> &emsp; Expressions such as God is light, God is love (<a href=1Jo.htm#v4_8>4:8</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v4_16>16</a>), and God is Spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_24>John 4:24</a>) are used not in a metaphoric sense but in a predicative sense. They denote and describe the nature of God. In His nature, God is Spirit, love, and light. Spirit denotes the nature of God&rsquo;s person; love, the nature of God&rsquo;s essence; and light, the nature of God&rsquo;s expression. Both love and light are related to God as life, which is of the Spirit (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_2>Rom. 8:2</a>). God, Spirit, and life are actually one. God is Spirit and Spirit is life. Within this life are love and light. When the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when the divine light shines on us, it becomes truth. John&rsquo;s Gospel reveals that the Lord Jesus brought grace and truth to us (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_17>17</a>) that we might have the divine life (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_14>John 3:14</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_16>16</a>), whereas John&rsquo;s Epistle unveils that the fellowship of the divine life brings us to the very source of grace and truth, which are the divine love and the divine light. John&rsquo;s Epistle is the continuation of his Gospel. In John&rsquo;s Gospel it is God in the Son coming to us as grace and truth that we may become His children (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_12>John 1:12</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_13>13</a>); in John&rsquo;s Epistle it is we, the children, in the fellowship of the Father&rsquo;s life, going to the Father to participate in His love and light (see <a href=1JoN.htm#n4_8x2>note 8<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=1Jo.htm#v4>ch. 4</a>). The former was God&rsquo;s coming out to the outer court to meet our need at the altar (<a href=Lev.htm#v4_28>Lev. 4:28</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v4_31>31</a>); the latter is our entering into the Holy of Holies to contact Him at the Ark (<a href=Exo.htm#v25_22>Exo. 25:22</a>). This is further and deeper in the experience of the divine life. After receiving the divine life by believing into the Son in John&rsquo;s Gospel, we should go on to enjoy this life through the fellowship of this life in John&rsquo;s Epistle. The entire Epistle discloses to us this one thing, that is, the enjoyment of the divine life through our abiding in its fellowship."
