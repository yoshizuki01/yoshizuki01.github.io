His desire to be the first corresponded with God&rsquo;s intention that he be the one who would receive the birthright. However, like his grandfather Abraham, Jacob exercised his natural ability and his natural strength to fulfill God&rsquo;s intention and satisfy his desire. Although God had chosen him to be the first, God sovereignly caused Jacob to be born the second so that he might learn that his natural man was altogether unworthy and had to be cut off. Since Jacob&rsquo;s natural man was not qualified, he needed to be transformed.<br> &emsp; The record of Jacob&rsquo;s life occupies more than half of the book of Genesis. This long record shows us that the purpose of God in His selecting, predestinating, and calling is to transform sinners into royal sons of God who bear God&rsquo;s image to express Him and exercise God&rsquo;s dominion to represent Him (cf. <a href=Gen.htm#v1_26>1:26</a>). God destined Jacob to live a struggling life all his days. Furthermore, God sovereignly arranged every circumstance, situation, and person in Jacob&rsquo;s life and caused them all to work together for Jacob&rsquo;s good, so that He could transform Jacob, a supplanter and a heel holder, into Israel, a prince of God. In particular, God used Jacob&rsquo;s family, including his father, his mother, his brother, his uncle, and his wives and children, to deal with Jacob for his transformation. God&rsquo;s dealing with Jacob is a full picture of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s discipline and His transforming work in the New Testament believers (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_28>Rom. 8:28</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>29</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v12_2>12:2</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_18>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18</a>)."

BD["W+*\x98"]="<b>Spirit</b><br> &emsp; The Galatians, through the hearing of the gospel, believed in the crucified Christ, but they received the Spirit. The One who was crucified on the cross was Christ, but the One who entered into the believers was the Spirit. In His being crucified for the believers&rsquo; redemption He was Christ, but in His indwelling the believers to be their life He is the Spirit. This is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who is the all-inclusive and ultimate blessing of the gospel. The believers receive such a divine Spirit by the hearing of faith, not by the works of law. He enters into the believers and lives in them not by their keeping of the law but by their faith in the crucified and resurrected Christ.<br> &emsp; In the first two chapters of this Epistle there is Christ in the divine revelation as the focal point of God&rsquo;s economy, but in the last four chapters there is the Spirit in our experience for us to have the divine life (<a href=Gal.htm#v3>ch. 3</a>), to be born of God (<a href=Gal.htm#v4>ch. 4</a>), to live and walk by the regenerated life (<a href=Gal.htm#v5>ch. 5</a>), and to take the divine purpose as our goal (<a href=Gal.htm#v6>ch. 6</a>).

BD["1.*\x97"]="<b>Ark</b><br> &emsp; God had done everything for David to establish him as king and to exalt his kingdom for the fulfillment of His purpose.

Whereas he was living in a house of cedar, the Ark, which represented God, still did not have a home (<a href=2Sa.htm#v7_2>7:2</a>). Unable to bear such a situation, David decided to remove the Ark of God to a permanent dwelling place. This indicates that David&rsquo;s heart was set on God&rsquo;s house, God&rsquo;s habitation. Whatever God does for us and whatever He gives to us should be altogether for our concern for the building up of God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. For God to have a house on earth is a great shame to His enemy, Satan. For generations Satan has been struggling to abuse, usurp, and occupy the earth. As a result, in a sense God has been driven away from the earth. That was the situation at David&rsquo;s time. However, David was for God; he was one with God and according to God. As a man according to God&rsquo;s heart (<a href=1Sa.htm#v13_14>1&nbsp;Sam. 13:14</a>), David desired to prepare a place where God could settle on the earth."

In this chapter, however, our bodies are to be presented as a living sacrifice for the church life. This sacrifice is living because it has life through resurrection; it is not like the sacrifices in the Old Testament, which were all slain. This sacrifice is also holy because, positionally, it has been separated unto God by the blood of Christ from the world and from all persons, matters, and things that are common; and because, dispositionally, the natural life and the old creation have been sanctified and transformed by the Holy Spirit with God&rsquo;s life and God&rsquo;s holy nature for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. Thus, this sacrifice is well pleasing to God.<br> &emsp; In Greek, bodies here is plural and sacrifice is singular. This indicates that, although many bodies are presented, they become one sacrifice, implying that, although we are many, our service in the Body of Christ should not be many individual services, separated and unrelated. All our service should constitute one whole service, and this service must be unique because it is the service of the one Body of Christ."

It signifies Christ as the cover of God&rsquo;s righteous law and also as the place where God meets with His redeemed people and speaks to them in grace (<a href=Exo.htm#v25_22>v. 22</a>). Hence, the expiation cover on the Ark in the Holy of Holies equals the throne of grace, the very Christ who dwells in our spirit (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_16>Heb. 4:16</a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n4_16x1>note 1</a>). According to <a href=Rev.htm#v8_3>Rev. 8:3</a>, it is also the throne of God&rsquo;s authority, the throne of the divine administration. The pure gold of which the cover was made signifies Christ&rsquo;s pure divine nature. See <a href=LevN.htm#n16_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Lev.htm#v16>Lev. 16</a>."

Behind our natural life are the forces of evil (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v16_23>Matt. 16:23</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n16_23x1>note 1</a>), who utilize, manipulate, and direct the aspects of our natural life to frustrate us from taking possession of the all-inclusive Christ and enjoying His riches.<br> &emsp; History shows that the pagan tribes in the land were the source of Israel&rsquo;s sin against God (cf. <a href=Exo.htm#v23_33>v. 33</a>). This indicates that our natural life is the source of our sins. In the sight of God, those who live according to the natural life are sinning continually, whether they do good or evil. Because the natural life frustrates us from possessing Christ and enjoying Him, we must hate it (<a href=Luk.htm#v14_26>Luke 14:26</a>) and, as we grow in Christ, be willing to drive it out.

In the degradation of the priesthood God&rsquo;s speaking was almost lost (<a href=1Sa.htm#v3_1>v. 1</a>). Thus, God needed to raise up a living person, a prophet, to speak for Him. In God&rsquo;s ordination Samuel is counted as the first prophet because he brought in the prophethood for God&rsquo;s speaking (<a href=Act.htm#v3_24>Acts 3:24</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v13_20>13:20</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v11_32>Heb. 11:32</a>)."

It was because Jerusalem was the source from which the heretical teaching concerning circumcision came. In order to solve the problem and uproot the trouble, they needed to go to the source. Unlike the situation with the Roman Catholic Church, according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy there is no headquarters for God&rsquo;s move on earth and no head church that controls other churches. The headquarters of God&rsquo;s move in His New Testament economy is in the heavens (<a href=Rev.htm#v4_2>Rev. 4:2</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v4_3>3</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v5_1>5:1</a>), and the One who rules over all the churches is Christ, the Head of the church (<a href=Col.htm#v1_18>Col. 1:18</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v2_1>Rev. 2:1</a>)."
