BD["B4)\x99"]="<b>book</b><br> &emsp; Those of the people of Israel who are found written in God&rsquo;s book of life will be delivered out of the hand of Antichrist. When Christ comes back to set up the kingdom, the small number of remaining Jews, the remnant of Israel (<a href=Zec.htm#v13_8>Zech. 13:8</a>&mdash;<a href=Zec.htm#v14_2>14:2</a> and <a href=ZecN.htm#n13_8x1>notes</a>), will see Christ descending in the air and will repent, receive Him, and be saved and regenerated (<a href=Zec.htm#v12_10>Zech. 12:10</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v12_14>14</a>; <a href=Zec.htm#v14_4>14:4</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v14_5>5</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v24_30>Matt. 24:30</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v11_26>Rom. 11:26</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v11_27>27</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v1_7>Rev. 1:7</a>). However, because they will be the later believers, they will not participate in the heavenly section of the kingdom as kings and priests, but rather will be kept on the earth to be the priests of God (<a href=Isa.htm#v2_2>Isa. 2:2</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v2_3>3</a>; <a href=Zec.htm#v8_20>Zech. 8:20</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v8_23>23</a>) in the earthly section of the thousand-year kingdom. See <a href=MatN.htm#n3_2x2>note 2<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v3>Matt. 3</a>.<br> &emsp; In the millennial kingdom there will be three groups of people: (1) the overcoming believers in the heavenly section as kings and priests in the heavenlies (see <a href=RevN.htm#n20_6x4>note 6<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v20>Rev. 20</a>); (2) the saved Jews who will be on the earth as the priests teaching the restored nations (see <a href=ZecN.htm#n8_20x1>note 20<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Zec.htm#v8>Zech. 8</a>); and (3) the restored nations as the citizens under the ruling of the overcoming believers as the co-kings of Christ and also under the teaching and care of the saved Jews (see notes <a href=MatN.htm#n25_32x1>32<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n25_34x1>34<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v25>Matt. 25</a>). After the thousand years of the age of the kingdom, the old heaven and the old earth will be burned in order to be renewed (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_12>2&nbsp;Pet. 3:12</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_13>13</a> and <a href=2PeN.htm#n3_12x1>notes</a>) and become a new heaven and new earth (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_1>Rev. 21:1</a>). At that time the Jews who are saved and regenerated by the Lord in His second coming will join all the believing saints of the Old Testament age and the New Testament age to be the New Jerusalem as God&rsquo;s dwelling place and expression for eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_12>Rev. 21:12</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_14>14</a>). The nations who remain at the end of the millennium will be transferred to the land in the new earth to be the citizens forever (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_24>Rev. 21:24</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_26>26</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_2>22:2b</a>). That will be the eternal kingdom of God, in which God&rsquo;s chosen, created, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified people, who are one with God for eternity, will rule over and teach the restored (but not regenerated) nations, who will be the citizens in the new heaven and the new earth. Eventually, in eternity in His eternal kingdom God will have His priests, His kings, and His people (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_3>Rev. 22:3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>5</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>21:3</a>) forever."
BD["i*6\x97"]="<b>teaching</b><br> &emsp; In these epistles the Lord desired, according to God&rsquo;s economy, that we eat Him as the tree of life (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_7>v. 7</a>), the hidden manna (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_17>v. 17</a>), and the rich produce of the good land (<a href=Rev.htm#v3_20>3:20</a>; see <a href=RevN.htm#n2_7x5>note 7<sup>5</sup></a> in this chapter); but the worldly church turned from life to mere teachings, thus distracting the believers from enjoying Christ as their life supply for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose. The enjoyment of Christ builds up the church, whereas teachings issue in a religion."
