BD[">4*\x97"]="<b>God</b><br> &emsp; This verse clearly reveals that salvation is God Himself. In the New Testament Jah Jehovah, who is salvation, is Jesus, the incarnated God (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_21>Matt. 1:21</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n1_21x1>note</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v2_30>Luke 2:30</a> and <a href=LukN.htm#n2_30x1>note</a>)."
BD["a()"]="Author: Apparently the apostle Paul, who alone was qualified to write the deep, high, and rich content of this book. The mention of Timothy and the tone of the fellowship also point to Paul as the author (see also <a href=HebN.htm#n1_1x1>note 1</a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v1_1>1:1</a>).<br>Time of Writing: Perhaps A.D. 67, after Paul's release from his first Roman imprisonment, while he was in Miletus (<a href=2Ti.htm#v4_20>2 Tim. 4:20</a>).<br>Place of Writing: Perhaps Miletus (see verse in the previous item). The mention of \"those from Italy\" in <a href=Heb.htm#v13_24>13:24</a> indicates that the book was not written in Rome.<br>Recipients: The Hebrew believers, as indicated by the book's content."

Righteousness and faithfulness are two of Christ&rsquo;s virtues for standing and fighting. He stands with faithfulness and fights with righteousness (<a href=Rev.htm#v19_11>Rev. 19:11</a>)."

This Epistle says first that God is light (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_5>1:5</a>) and then that God is love. Love, as the nature of God&rsquo;s essence, is the source of grace, and light, as the nature of God&rsquo;s expression, is the source of truth. When the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when the divine light shines upon us, it becomes truth (see <a href=1JoN.htm#n1_6x6P12>note 6<sup>6</sup>, final par.</a>, in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1>ch. 1</a>). Both of these were manifested in this way in John&rsquo;s Gospel. We received both grace and truth there through the manifestation of the Son (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_16>16</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_17>17</a>). Now in John&rsquo;s Epistle we come in the Son to the Father and touch the sources of both grace and truth. These sources, love and light, are God the Father Himself for our deeper and finer enjoyment in the fellowship of the divine life with the Father in the Son (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_3>1:3</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_7>7</a>) through our abiding in Him (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_5>2:5</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_27>27</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_28>28</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_6>3:6</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_24>24</a>).

BD[":?-\x97"]="<b>table</b><br> &emsp; In the fourth stage of His shepherding, in the deeper and higher enjoyment of the resurrected Christ, the Lord spreads a table, a feast (Christ with His riches for our enjoyment), before us in the presence of our adversaries. If we fight the spiritual battle and defeat the adversaries, we will have a rich enjoyment of the Lord as our feast at His table (cf. <a href=Gen.htm#v14_17>Gen. 14:17</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v14_18>18</a>)."

Although we conduct ourselves and labor in the grace and power of God (<a href=2Co.htm#v1_12>2&nbsp;Cor. 1:12</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v15_10>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:10</a>), we should be very human in our living, cooperating with God in a human way and fulfilling our human duty. This is to be balanced. That the human hands are under eagle&rsquo;s wings indicates that in doing everything we should be under God&rsquo;s grace and under His covering, depending on the Lord and expressing Him."

This is a wrong concept. God saves us not because of our righteousness but because of His mercy and His compassion (<a href=Lam.htm#v3_22>Lam. 3:22</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_1>Eph. 2:1</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_9>9</a>; <a href=Tit.htm#v3_5>Titus 3:5</a>) and because of His own purpose (<a href=2Ti.htm#v1_9>2&nbsp;Tim. 1:9</a>)."
