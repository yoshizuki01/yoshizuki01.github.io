BD["i9+\x98"]="<b>wilderness</b><br> &emsp; A wilderness is a desert place. This indicates that the apostate church is in a desert, where there are no springs of water prepared by God. In order to show the apostle John that the apostate church is in such a desolate place, the angel carried him there."
BD[":U1\x97"]="<b>The</b><br> &emsp; Verses <a href=Psa.htm#v45_9>9</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v45_15>15</a> praise Christ the King in praising the queen with the daughters of kings and with the virgins (<a href=Psa.htm#v45_14>v. 14</a>)."
BD["e*D)o10"]="<b>A.</b>&nbsp; To practice the divine righteousness"
BD["i68\x8c"]="And He who sat on the cloud thrust His sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped."
BD["L*<)o9"]="<b>C.</b>&nbsp; The promise concerning the Messiah (typified by Zerubbabel) in the coming kingdom"
BD["?F1\x97"]="<b>David</b><br> &emsp; Referring to Christ, who is the real David (see <a href=2SaN.htm#n7_16x1>note 16<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=2Sa.htm#v7>2&nbsp;Sam. 7</a>) and who will be the King in the restoration, i.e., the millennium (<a href=Isa.htm#v32_1>Isa. 32:1</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>Rev. 20:4</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>). David was a type of Christ as the King."
BD["i64\x98"]="<b>saints</b><br> &emsp; The saints who remain in the great tribulation are of two peoples: the Jews, who keep the commandments of God, and the believers, who keep the faith of Jesus."
BD[">J.\x97"]="<b>sacrifice</b><br> &emsp; This sacrifice in Bozrah and slaughter in the land of Edom will be fulfilled in full in the great war at Armageddon, which will take place in a region that extends to Bozrah (<a href=Isa.htm#v63_1>63:1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v63_6>6</a> and <a href=IsaN.htm#n63_2x1>note 2<sup>1</sup></a>)."

BD["i57\x98"]="<b>speak</b><br> &emsp; No idol made by man has ever been able to speak (<a href=Psa.htm#v115_5>Psa. 115:5</a>), but this last idol will be enabled to speak as a living image. This surely will be a marvelous sign to those who dwell on the earth, and will cause them all to worship the idol."
BD["R44)o100"]="<b>2.</b>&nbsp; Life's multiplication for the church through death and resurrection (the glorification of God and the judgment upon the world and Satan implied)"
BD["i4:\x98"]="<b>sea</b><br> &emsp; The sea here is the same as that in <a href=Rev.htm#v13_1>13:1</a>, the Mediterranean Sea. The sand of the sea here should be the seashore of the Holy Land, where the nation of Israel is. That the dragon will stand on the sand of the sea and that the holy city, Jerusalem, will be trampled for forty-two months (<a href=Rev.htm#v11_2>11:2</a>) indicate that Satan&rsquo;s persecution during the great tribulation will be carried out mainly in the land of Israel."

Although there were other genuine prophets (cf. <a href=Jer.htm#v25_4>25:4</a>), most of the prophets in Judah were false. These false prophets did not have a way to receive Jehovah&rsquo;s word, so they listened to those who spoke for God and then stole the words of Jehovah spoken by them. They pretended that they themselves had received this revelation from God and that the words they were speaking were their own."
