BD["?*H\x98"]="<b>without</b><br> &emsp; Israel&rsquo;s forsaking of God for idols and their breaking of God&rsquo;s commandments began with the worshipping of the golden calf at Mount Sinai (<a href=Exo.htm#v32_1>Exo. 32:1</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v32_6>6</a>). Later, in his respeaking of the divine law Moses charged Israel especially that when they entered the good land, they were to tear down the idols, destroy the places of idol worship, and slaughter the idol worshippers (<a href=Deu.htm#v7_2>Deut. 7:2</a>, <a href=Deu.htm#v7_5>5</a>). Israel, however, did not obey the commandment to utterly destroy the idol worshippers. As a result, Israel could not fully possess the good land, and there was war repeatedly between Israel and the people in the land. After David had fought all the inhabitants of the land and gained nearly the entire land, and Solomon, his son, had built the temple in about 1000 B.C., in his old age Solomon was led by his many heathen wives to worship idols (<a href=1Ki.htm#v11_1>1&nbsp;Kings 11:1</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v11_8>8</a>). Nearly all his descendants continued his apostasy. Eventually, Israel&rsquo;s worshipping of idols and their breaking of the law reached its peak at the time of Jeremiah. At that time Israel was in the sunset of the divine revelation. Cf. <a href=JdgN.htm#n2_12x1>note 12<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Jdg.htm#v2>Judg. 2</a>."
