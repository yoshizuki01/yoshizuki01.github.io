BD["OBC\x97"]="<b>cup</b><br> &emsp; The Lord&rsquo;s blood redeemed us from our fallen condition back to God and back to God&rsquo;s full blessing. Concerning the Lord&rsquo;s table (<a href=1Co.htm#v10_21>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:21</a>), the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God&rsquo;s blessing. Hence, the cup is called &ldquo;the cup of blessing&rdquo; (<a href=1Co.htm#v10_16>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:16</a>). In it are all the blessings of God and even God Himself as our portion (<a href=Psa.htm#v16_5>Psa. 16:5</a>). In Adam our portion was the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath (<a href=Rev.htm#v14_10>Rev. 14:10</a>). Christ drank that cup for us (<a href=Joh.htm#v18_11>John 18:11</a>), and His blood constitutes the cup of salvation for us (<a href=Psa.htm#v116_13>Psa. 116:13</a>), the cup that runs over (<a href=Psa.htm#v23_5>Psa. 23:5</a>).

BD["R=7\x97"]="<b>Simon</b><br> &emsp; Here the Lord was restoring Peter&rsquo;s love toward Him. Peter did have a heart to love the Lord, but he was too confident in his own strength, his natural strength. His love for the Lord was precious, but his natural strength had to be denied and dealt with. The Lord allowed Peter to fail utterly in denying the Lord to His face three times (<a href=Joh.htm#v18_17>18:17</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v18_25>25</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v18_27>27</a>), so that his natural strength and his self-confidence could be dealt with. Furthermore, Peter had just taken the lead to backslide from the Lord&rsquo;s call. His natural confidence in his love toward the Lord also must have been dealt with by this failure; yet he might have been somewhat disappointed. The Lord therefore came to restore his love toward Him, to charge him with the shepherding of His church, and to prepare him for his martyrdom so that he would not follow Him with any confidence in his natural strength."

BD["W-:\x97"]="<b>Spirit</b><br> &emsp; The law is related to our flesh (<a href=Rom.htm#v7_5>Rom. 7:5</a>), and our flesh is against the Spirit (<a href=Gal.htm#v5_17>v. 17</a>). Hence, the Spirit is in contrast to the law. When we walk by the Spirit, who is in our regenerated spirit, we will not fulfill the lusts of our flesh (<a href=Gal.htm#v5_16>v. 16</a>); when we are led by the Spirit, we are not under the law. The Spirit of life, not the law of letters, is our guiding principle, regulating our Christian walk in our regenerated spirit."
BD["Q4[\x97"]="<b>division</b><br> &emsp; This is because the satanic life in the unbelievers is struggling against the divine life in the believers&mdash;a conflict between the satanic kingdom and the kingdom of God.

The apostle wanted the Galatians to know that they were children of the Jerusalem above, children of the free woman, and he wanted them to appropriate the covenant of promise and, according to the Spirit, enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit as the blessing of the gospel (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_14>3:14</a>). In this section Sarah, the free woman, symbolizes the covenant of promise, which is symbolized also by the Jerusalem above, who is our mother; the mother symbolizes grace, by which we are born to be the children of God, who is the very source of grace. Hence, the free woman, the covenant of promise, the Jerusalem above, and the mother all refer to God&rsquo;s grace, which is the very means of our spiritual birth. It was from this grace&mdash;Christ&mdash;that the Galatians who had been distracted by Judaism fell away (<a href=Gal.htm#v5_4>5:4</a>)."

BD["Y*0\x9a"]="<b>death</b><br> &emsp; The death of a cross is the climax of Christ&rsquo;s humiliation. To the Jews it was a curse (<a href=Deu.htm#v21_22>Deut. 21:22</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v21_23>23</a>). To the Gentiles it was a death sentence imposed on malefactors and slaves (<a href=Mat.htm#v27_16>Matt. 27:16</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v27_17>17</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v27_20>20</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v27_23>23</a>). Hence, it was a shameful thing (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_2>Heb. 12:2</a>).<br> &emsp; The Lord&rsquo;s humiliation involved seven steps: (1) emptying Himself; (2) taking the form of a slave; (3) becoming in the likeness of men; (4) humbling Himself; (5) becoming obedient; (6) being obedient even unto death; and (7) being obedient unto the death of the cross."

The fruit of the light must be good in nature, righteous in procedure, and real in expression, that God may be expressed as the reality of our daily walk.<br> &emsp; The fruit of the light in goodness, righteousness, and truth is related to the Triune God. Goodness denotes God the Father, for the only one who is good is God (<a href=Mat.htm#v19_17>Matt. 19:17</a>). Righteousness denotes God the Son, for Christ came to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose according to God&rsquo;s righteous procedure (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_17>Rom. 5:17</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v5_18>18</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v5_21>21</a>).
