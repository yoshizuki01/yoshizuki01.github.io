In the book of Ezekiel God&rsquo;s economy and God&rsquo;s move in His economy are signified by a wheel. The hub of this great wheel signifies Christ as the center of God&rsquo;s economy, and the rim signifies Christ&rsquo;s counterpart, the church, which consummates in the New Jerusalem. The spokes of the wheel spreading from the hub to the rim signify the many believers as the members of Christ.<br> &emsp; The appearing of the wheels on the earth beside the living creatures indicates that God&rsquo;s move on earth follows the coordination of the four living creatures. The move by a wheel implies an extraordinary move with a purpose. Furthermore, it implies that this move is not by our own strength."
