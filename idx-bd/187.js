BD["AP*\x97"]="<b>land</b><br> &emsp; To see the vision of God&rsquo;s holy building, Ezekiel was brought from the land of captivity to a high mountain, signifying the resurrection and ascension of Christ, in the land of Israel, a type of the all-inclusive Christ as the portion allotted by God to His people (see <a href=DeuN.htm#n8_7x1>note 7<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Deu.htm#v8>Deut. 8</a>), and in the city of Jerusalem. This was the right position, standing, and angle for Ezekiel to see such a vision. See <a href=RevN.htm#n21_10x1>note 10<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v21>Rev. 21</a>."
BD["M,*\x97"]="<b>lampstand</b><br> &emsp; The priesthood of Joshua signifies the priesthood of the nation of Israel toward the nations for God. The lampstand of gold signifies the shining testimony of the nation of Israel toward the nations for God. God had chosen Israel to be a nation of priests (<a href=Exo.htm#v19_6>Exo. 19:6</a>). His intention was to use the nation of Israel as a priesthood to bring the nations to God that they might enter into God&rsquo;s presence to be enlightened, exposed, dealt with, and transfused by God with the divine riches. Furthermore, the priests were to teach the nations how to worship God and serve God (cf. <a href=Zec.htm#v8_20>8:20</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v8_23>23</a>). In addition to being a nation of priests, Israel was to be a testimony standing for God.<br> &emsp; Intrinsically, the lampstand signifies the Triune God embodied and expressed. In <a href=Exo.htm#v25>Exo. 25</a> the lampstand signifies Christ as the embodiment and expression of the Triune God. Here the lampstand signifies the nation of Israel as the collective testimony of God, shining out all His virtues. For the details concerning the lampstand, see <a href=ExoN.htm#n25_31x1>notes</a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v25_31>Exo. 25:31</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v25_40>40</a>."

Not only before the fall of Jerusalem, but even in the fall and after the fall of Jerusalem, Israel remained stubborn in their sinning against Jehovah. Yet Jeremiah remained firm in his speaking for Jehovah."
BD["M*0\x97"]="<b>After</b><br> &emsp; The expression after the glory means after the return of the captives. In the seventy years of Israel&rsquo;s captivity, the glory was absent from the center of Jerusalem (<a href=Ezk.htm#v11_23>Ezek. 11:23</a> and <a href=EzkN.htm#n11_23x1>note 1</a>). But when the children of Israel returned to Jerusalem, the glory also returned. In the sight of God the return of the captives was a glory."

The name Rahab refers to a monster, to a large sea animal. This indicates that God regards Egypt as a monster, as an ugly, terrifying sea animal."

BD["?Q9\x97"]="<b>Egypt</b><br> &emsp; When they were weak or in trouble, the people of Israel were often tempted to go back to Egypt, which typifies the world, and take Egypt as their refuge, against Jehovah&rsquo;s will (<a href=Jer.htm#v42_14>42:14</a>&mdash;<a href=Jer.htm#v43_7>43:7</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v30_1>Isa. 30:1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v30_3>3</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v31_1>31:1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v31_3>3</a>). The fact that Egypt did not help Judah when Judah was besieged by the Chaldeans (<a href=Jer.htm#v37_5>37:5</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v37_8>8</a>) is a sign that God&rsquo;s people should not trust in the world."
