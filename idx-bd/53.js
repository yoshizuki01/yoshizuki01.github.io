Furthermore, they become burning torches for shining and enlightening (cf. <a href=Rev.htm#v4_5>Rev. 4:5b</a>). The burning of the coals and the enlightening of the torches signify that the sanctifying fire becomes the sanctifying light. That both the Lord on the throne (<a href=Ezk.htm#v1_26>v. 26</a>) and the living creatures have the appearance of fire indicates that the living creatures are the expression of the Lord."
