BD["I))\x97"]="<b>Nineveh</b><br> &emsp; See <a href=JonN.htm#n1_2x1>note 2<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Jon.htm#v1>Jonah 1</a>. The prophecies of both Jonah and Nahum relate to the city of Nineveh. Whereas Jonah brought, or extended, God&rsquo;s salvation to that sinful city, Nahum brought God&rsquo;s judgment upon it. Jonah reveals that God in His salvation is the God of all the peoples of the earth, not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles (see <a href=JonN.htm#n4_11x1>note 11<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Jon.htm#v4>Jonah 4</a>). Nahum reveals that God is also the God of all peoples in His judgment. Thus, God is the God of all peoples both in judgment and in salvation.<br> &emsp; Although He extended His salvation to Nineveh, God judged Nineveh because Nineveh was sinful and invaded Israel (<a href=2Ki.htm#v15_19>2&nbsp;Kings 15:19</a>-<a href=2Ki.htm#v15_20>20</a>, <a href=2Ki.htm#v15_29>29</a>; <a href=2Ki.htm#v17_3>17:3</a>-<a href=2Ki.htm#v17_6>6</a>; <a href=2Ki.htm#v18_9>18:9</a>&mdash;<a href=2Ki.htm#v19_37>19:37</a>).

These seven nations were selected as representative of all the nations. They signify seven kinds of people who are a damage to the church as God&rsquo;s New Testament people. The seven nations are divided into three groups according to the three separate visions seen by Ezekiel at three different times.

BD["i6/\x98"]="<b>judgment</b><br> &emsp; The judgment here is the judgment that Christ will execute over all the nations at His coming back to earth, as He predicted in <a href=Mat.htm#v25_31>Matt. 25:31</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v25_46>46</a>. This judgment will be executed on the living. It differs from the judgment on the dead, which will take place after the millennium, as mentioned in <a href=Rev.htm#v20_11>Rev. 20:11</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_15>15</a>. All the people of the nations who remain at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back to earth will be judged according to the eternal gospel preached by the angel during the great tribulation (<a href=Mat.htm#v24_21>Matt. 24:21</a>). If in fearing and worshipping God they have treated well the Christians and Jews, the Lord&rsquo;s brothers suffering poverty and imprisonment under Antichrist&rsquo;s persecution during the great tribulation, they will be justified by the Lord so that they can enter into the earthly part of the millennium to partake of the kingdom prepared by God for them from the foundation of the world (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_34>Matt. 25:34</a>). If in following Antichrist and worshipping his image they have ill-treated the Christians and Jews, they will be condemned and cast into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_41>Matt. 25:41</a>)."
