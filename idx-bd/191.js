Hence, God&rsquo;s economy is that the &ldquo;I&rdquo; be crucified in Christ&rsquo;s death and that Christ live in us in His resurrection. To keep the law is to exalt it above all things in our life; to live Christ is to make Him the center and everything in our life. The law was used by God for a period of time to keep His chosen people in custody for Christ (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_23>3:23</a>) and eventually to conduct them to Christ (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_24>3:24</a>) that they might receive Him as life and live Him to be God&rsquo;s expression.
