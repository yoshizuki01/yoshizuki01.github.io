As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us that we may partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness. As the High Priest, Christ went to God with us to present us to God that we and all our case may be fully cared for by Him. As the Apostle, He is typified by Moses, who came from God to serve the house of God (vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v3_2>2</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v3_6>6</a>), and as the High Priest, He is typified by Aaron, who went to God with the house of Israel and their cases (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_14>4:14</a>&mdash;<a href=Heb.htm#v7_28>7:28</a>)."

In Judaism the boast was in God, angels, Moses, Aaron the high priest, and the Old Testament with its services. Initially, the writer points out that in God&rsquo;s salvation the first superior thing is not only God but God expressed, i.e., God the Son (vv. <a href=Heb.htm#v1_2>2</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v1_3>3</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v1_5>5</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v1_8>8</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v1_12>12</a>). Then he goes on to unfold that Christ is superior to angels (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_4>1:4</a>&mdash;<a href=Heb.htm#v2_18>2:18</a>), to Moses (<a href=Heb.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v3_6>6</a>), and to Aaron (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_14>4:14</a>&mdash;<a href=Heb.htm#v7_28>7:28</a>) and that the new covenant of life made by Him is superior to the old covenant of letters (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_1>8:1</a>&mdash;<a href=Heb.htm#v10_18>10:18</a>)."
