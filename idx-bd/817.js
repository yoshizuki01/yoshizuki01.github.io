BD["_+5\x97"]="<b>Zenas</b><br> &emsp; Artemas and Tychicus were intimate fellow workers of Paul; Zenas and Apollos worked independently of him. Yet Paul still charged Titus to care for the latter two, showing that there was no jealousy between the two groups of co-workers."
BD["^*A\x97"]="<b>repentance</b><br> &emsp; This indicates that with the opposers of the truth it is the heart and conscience that are in question. The truth is the revelation of the living God and His economy, His heart&rsquo;s desire. To receive the divine revelation, the heart and conscience need to be rightly exercised toward God. The heart should be turned to Him, directed solely to Him, and the conscience must be pure and void of offense before Him. Otherwise, one may be carried away as a captive by the devil and thus fall into his snare (<a href=2Ti.htm#v2_26>v. 26</a>)."

Now He is the revealed God.<br> &emsp; The emphasis of this book is that God, not man, has spoken. Therefore, it does not identify its writer, nor in any of its quotations from the Old Testament does it mention the speaker&rsquo;s name. According to the concept of this book, the entire Scripture is the speaking of God. Hence, in referring to the Old Testament, this book always says that it is the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s speaking (<a href=Heb.htm#v3_7>3:7</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v9_8>9:8</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v10_15>10:15</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_17>17</a>)."
