BD["U8)\x97"]="<b>collection</b><br> &emsp; This is the eleventh matter dealt with by the apostle in this Epistle, a matter concerned with money, mammon, and material possessions. All of fallen mankind is under the domination of mammon and material possessions (<a href=Mat.htm#v6_19>Matt. 6:19</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v6_21>21</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v6_24>24</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v6_25>25</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v6_30>30</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v19_21>19:21</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v19_22>22</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v12_13>Luke 12:13</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v12_19>19</a>). On the day of Pentecost, under the power of the Holy Spirit, all the believers overthrew this domination and had all their possessions in common for distribution to the needy ones (<a href=Act.htm#v2_44>Acts 2:44</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v2_45>45</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v4_32>4:32</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v4_34>34</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v4_37>37</a>). Because of the weakness of the believers&rsquo; fallen nature (cf. <a href=Act.htm#v5_1>Acts 5:1</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v5_11>11</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v6_1>6:1</a>), that practice did not last long. It had already ended by the apostle Paul&rsquo;s time. Hence, the believers needed grace to overcome the power of mammon and material things and to release these things from Satan&rsquo;s domination that they might be offered to the Lord for the fulfillment of His purpose. Resurrection life is the supply for the believers to live such a life, a life trusting in God, not in material possessions, a life not for today but for the future, not for this age but for the coming age (<a href=Luk.htm#v12_16>Luke 12:16</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v12_21>21</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v6_17>1&nbsp;Tim. 6:17</a>-<a href=1Ti.htm#v6_19>19</a>), a life that overthrows the usurpation of temporal and uncertain riches. This may be the reason that the dealing with this matter comes after the dealing concerning the reality of resurrection life. In any case, this dealing is related to God&rsquo;s administration among the churches."
