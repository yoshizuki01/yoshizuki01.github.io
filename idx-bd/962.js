BD["f)3\x97"]="<b>evil</b><br> &emsp; Just as bringing to others the divine truth of the wonderful Christ is an excellent deed (<a href=Rom.htm#v10_15>Rom. 10:15</a>), so spreading the satanic heresy, which defiles the glorious deity of Christ, is an evil work. It is a blasphemy and abomination to God. It is also a damage and curse to men. No one who is a believer in Christ and a child of God should have any share in this evil! Even to greet such an evil one is prohibited! A severe and clear separation from this evil should be maintained!"

BD["e+6\x97"]="<b>death</b><br> &emsp; Death is of the devil, God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, signified by the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which brings death; life is of God, the source of life, signified by the tree of life, which issues in life (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>Gen. 2:9</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v2_16>16</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_17>17</a>). Death and life are not only of two sources, Satan and God; they are also two essences, two elements, and two spheres. To pass out of death into life is to pass out of the source, the essence, the element, and the sphere of death into the source, the essence, the element, and the sphere of life. This took place in us at our regeneration. We know this, i.e., have the inner consciousness of it, because we love the brothers. Love (the love of God) toward the brothers is strong evidence of this. Faith in the Lord is the way for us to pass out of death into life; love toward the brothers is the evidence that we have passed out of death into life. To have faith is to receive the eternal life; to love is to live by the eternal life and express it."

Although believers cannot be lost, they may suffer some dispensational punishment for their failures. This punishment will be worse than that received by those who broke the law of letters."
