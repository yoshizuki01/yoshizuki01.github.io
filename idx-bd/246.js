BD["a+.\x97"]="<b>house</b><br> &emsp; In Old Testament times the house of God was the house of Israel (<a href=Lev.htm#v22_18>Lev. 22:18</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v12_7>Num. 12:7</a>), symbolized by the tabernacle or the temple, which was in Israel&rsquo;s midst (<a href=Exo.htm#v25_8>Exo. 25:8</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v37_26>Ezek. 37:26</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v37_27>27</a>). Today, the house of God is actually the church (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v4_17>1&nbsp;Pet. 4:17</a>). The children of Israel, as people of God, are a type of us, the New Testament believers (<a href=1Co.htm#v9_24>1&nbsp;Cor. 9:24</a>&mdash;<a href=1Co.htm#v10_11>10:11</a>). Their entire history is a prefigure of the church."
BD["b)+\x97"]="<b>faith</b><br> &emsp; The Christian faith, given by God in Christ (<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_1>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:1</a>; <a href=Jam.htm#v2_1>James 2:1</a>)."
BD[":\x9f1\x97"]="<b>word</b><br> &emsp; Christ is the reality of the law in the sense of its being not only the testimony of God but also the word of God. In total, He is the Word of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>John 1:1</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v19_13>Rev. 19:13b</a>). The words of this psalm are the written words of God, but Christ is the living Word of God breathed out by God (<a href=2Ti.htm#v3_16>2&nbsp;Tim. 3:16a</a>). The written words are the letters, but the living Word is the Spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_63>John 6:63</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v6_17>Eph. 6:17</a>), who is the reality of the letters. The law is the person of Christ, and the person of Christ is the Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:17</a>). The Spirit is the reality of whatever God is (<a href=Joh.htm#v16_13>John 16:13</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_6>1&nbsp;John 5:6</a>). Hence, as the Spirit, Christ is the reality of the law."
BD["a*1\x97"]="<b>inferior</b><br> &emsp; In eternity Christ was the Creator, unlimited and omnipresent, but when He became a man in time, He was limited so that one day He could go to the cross to deal with the universal problem&mdash;death. In order to suffer death and thus destroy and nullify death, Christ had to become a man and lose His freedom temporarily, for thirty-three and a half years. In that sense, He was inferior to the angels during that period. However, three days after His death He resurrected out of that inferiority and is now much superior to all the angels."
