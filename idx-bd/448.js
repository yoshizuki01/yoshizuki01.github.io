This was required by God to usher Moses into his ministry, for an uncircumcised person, one who still lives in the flesh or the natural life, could have no part in God&rsquo;s ministry or in the covenant God made with Abraham regarding the inheriting of the good land (<a href=Gen.htm#v17_9>Gen. 17:9</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v17_15>15</a>).

The putting of the ashes beside the altar toward the east (<a href=Lev.htm#v1_16>1:16</a>), the side of the sunrise, is an allusion to resurrection. In relation to the burnt offering, the ashes are not the end, for Christ&rsquo;s death brings in resurrection (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_3>Rom. 6:3</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v6_5>5</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v4_10>2&nbsp;Cor. 4:10</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v4_12>12</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v3_10>Phil. 3:10</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_11>11</a>).
