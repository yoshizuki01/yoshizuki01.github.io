BD["AF-\x97"]="<b>Libya</b><br> &emsp; Following the rendering of the Septuagint; the Hebrew reads, Cub."
BD["i>.\x8c"]="And he said to me, These words are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must quickly take place."
BD["I+6\x97"]="<b>ready</b><br> &emsp; Or, strong."
BD["i=1\x8c"]="And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."
BD[":[-\x97"]="<b>brought</b><br> &emsp; To confess, as David did here, that we were born in sin indicates that we have no trust in ourselves (cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v7_18>Rom. 7:18</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v3_3>Phil. 3:3</a>). Realizing that we are sinful and God is holy, we trust only in Him. Also, we realize that we need Christ to be our Mediator and our sacrifice (see <a href=PsaN.htm#n51_7x1>note 7<sup>1</sup></a>)."
BD["i>*\x98"]="<b>fruits</b><br> &emsp; The fruits of the tree of life will be the food of God&rsquo;s redeemed for eternity. They will be continually fresh, being produced every month, twelve fruits yearly. That the tree of life bears twelve fruits means that the fruit of the tree of life is rich and is sufficient for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s eternal administration."
BD[":\x9f\xb2\x8c"]="You have commanded Your testimonies in righteousness / And great faithfulness."
BD["i>)\x9b"]="<b>throne</b><br> &emsp; The throne of God and of the Lamb, showing that there is one throne for both God and the Lamb, indicates that God and the Lamb are one&mdash;the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, God the Redeemer. In eternity the very God who sits on the throne is our redeeming God, from whose throne proceeds the river of water of life for our supply and satisfaction. This depicts how the Triune God&mdash;God, the Lamb, and the Spirit, who is symbolized by the water of life&mdash;dispenses Himself to His redeemed under His headship (implied in the authority of the throne) for eternity."
BD["i<4\x8c"]="And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened; and another scroll was opened, which is <I>the</I> <I>book</I> of life. And the dead were judged by the things which were written in the scrolls, according to their works."
BD["i;7\x8c"]="And out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations; and He will shepherd them with an iron rod; and He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty."
BD["i<0\x98"]="<b>war</b><br> &emsp; This will be the last war on earth. It will be caused by mankind&rsquo;s last rebellion, which will be instigated by Satan, God&rsquo;s enemy, after the millennium. Although mankind will be in a restored state for one thousand years, man&rsquo;s rebellious nature will still remain. It will be exposed by Satan&rsquo;s last instigation and will be purged away by the Lord&rsquo;s final judgment on mankind."
BD["?AN\x97"]="<b>oppressing</b><br> &emsp; According to the Septuagint and some Hebrew MSS (cf. <a href=Jer.htm#v46_16>46:16</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v50_16>50:16</a>); others read, fierceness of the oppressor."
BD[":X6\x97"]="<b>guide</b><br> &emsp; In the enjoyment of God in the city, God is our refuge (<a href=Psa.htm#v46_1>46:1</a>), our retreat (<a href=Psa.htm#v46_7>46:7</a>), and our guide. This enjoyment of God is through Christ, in Christ, and with Christ, and it is experienced in the universal church as the Body of Christ and in the local churches as the expressions of the Body.<br> &emsp; The Psalms indicate that we first need to experience Christ. Then Christ will lead us to the local church to enjoy God (<a href=Psa.htm#v23_6>23:6</a>). When the church as the house of God is enlarged and strengthened, it becomes the city&mdash;the kingdom for God&rsquo;s ruling and reigning (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_19>19</a>). In the church as the house we enjoy God in the aspect of His dwelling. In the church as the city we enjoy God in the aspect of His ruling and reigning."
BD["i::\x8c"]="And cried out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What <I>city</I> is like the great city?"
BD["i;3\x98"]="<b>Faithful</b><br> &emsp; Christ is faithful both to God and to those who believe in Him. In His faithfulness He defeats and destroys those who oppose God and persecute the believers. He is also true in carrying out God&rsquo;s economy and in caring for those who believe in Him."

BD["J*0\x97"]="<b>plunder</b><br> &emsp; This plundering of Babylon by the nations, as God&rsquo;s recompense on Babylon, took place a little more than eighty-five years after Habakkuk&rsquo;s prophecy (see <a href=Dan.htm#v5>Dan. 5</a>)."
