BD["?GJ\x99"]="<b>NA</b><br> &emsp; Jeremiah reveals what God wants from us, what we are in our fallen condition, and what Christ is to us. God wants us to take Him as our source and to drink of Him so that He may become the river of water of life within us (<a href=Jer.htm#v2_13>2:13</a>; cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v7_37>John 7:37</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v7_39>39</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>Rev. 22:1</a>). However, we forsook Him, and in our fallen condition we became hopeless, utterly corrupt, incurable, and unchangeable (<a href=Jer.htm#v13_23>13:23</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v17_9>17:9</a>). But Christ has come to be our righteousness (<a href=Jer.htm#v23_5>23:5</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v23_6>6</a>) and our inner life (<a href=Jer.htm#v31_33>v. 33</a>). Outwardly, He is our righteousness for us to be justified by God, and inwardly, He is the divine life to fill us, to make us one with God, and even to constitute us with God that we may live God (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>Phil. 1:21a</a>). Christ&rsquo;s being our righteousness and our inner life causes us to be a corporate Body, the organism of the Triune God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. These matters are the kernel of the book of Jeremiah, and they are also the complete teaching of the entire Bible."

BD["i>9\x97"]="<b>Spirit</b><br> &emsp; In chs. <a href=Rev.htm#v2>2</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v3>3</a> it was the Spirit speaking to the churches; here, at the end of the book, it is the Spirit and the bride, the church, speaking together as one. This indicates that the church&rsquo;s experience of the Spirit has improved to the extent that she has become one with the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.<br> &emsp; The entire revelation of the Bible shows us the love story of a universal couple. That is, the sovereign Lord, who created the universe and all things, the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;who went through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and who ultimately became the life-giving Spirit, is joined in marriage to the created, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man&mdash;composed of spirit, soul, and body&mdash;who ultimately constitutes the church, the expression of God. In the eternity that is without end, by the divine, eternal, and surpassingly glorious life, they will live a life that is the mingling of God and man as one spirit, a life that is superexcellent and that overflows with blessings and joy."

BD["i>8\x9a"]="<b>morning</b><br> &emsp; At His coming back Christ will be the rising sun to His people generally (<a href=Mal.htm#v4_2>Mal. 4:2</a>) but the morning star to His watching lovers particularly. The latter will be a reward to the overcomers (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_28>2:28</a>). Christ&rsquo;s being the Root and Offspring of David is related to Israel and the kingdom, whereas Christ&rsquo;s being the bright morning star is related to the church and the rapture. The morning star appears before the darkest hour, prior to the dawn. The great tribulation will be this darkest time, after which the day of the kingdom will dawn. In the kingdom the Lord will appear publicly to His people as the sun, but before the great tribulation He will appear privately to His overcomers as the morning star."
