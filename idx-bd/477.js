Hope reaps and partakes of the things substantiated by faith (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_24>Rom. 8:24</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_25>25</a>).

We, His believers, have all received His salvation through faith in Him. This has been settled once for all. But whether we will be rewarded by Him depends on how we run the race. Here, in this chapter, the apostle was running the course (<a href=1Co.htm#v9_26>v. 26</a>). In Philippians, one of his last Epistles, he was still running (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_14>Phil. 3:14</a>). It was not until the last moment of his running, in <a href=2Ti.htm#v4_6>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:6</a>-<a href=2Ti.htm#v4_8>8</a>, that he had the assurance that he would be rewarded by the Lord at His appearing.

To believe in the Lord is to receive Him; to love the Lord is to enjoy Him. The Lord came as life and the life supply to us. We need to have faith in Him and love toward Him. This Gospel presents these as the two requirements for us to participate in the Lord."

Later, Peter in his first Epistle indicated this, saying that growth by feeding on the pure milk of the word is for the building of God&rsquo;s house (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_2>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:2</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>5</a>) and charging the elders to shepherd the flock of God (<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_1>1&nbsp;Pet. 5:1</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v5_4>4</a>)."
