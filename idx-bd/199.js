The overcoming in chs. <a href=Rev.htm#v2>2</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v3>3</a> qualifies the overcoming believers to participate in the enjoyment of the millennial kingdom as a particular reward in God&rsquo;s dispensational administration, whereas the overcoming here qualifies all believers to participate in the New Jerusalem with all its enjoyment as the common portion of God&rsquo;s eternal salvation."
