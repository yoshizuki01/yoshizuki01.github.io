It was far from the holy city and the holy temple, where the atmosphere of the old Jewish religion filled every man&rsquo;s thought, leaving no room for Christ, the new King. The Lord brought His disciples purposely to such a place with its clear atmosphere that their thought might be released from the effects of the religious surroundings in the holy city and holy temple and that He might reveal to them something new concerning Himself and the church, which are the pulse of His heavenly kingdom. It was in Caesarea Philippi that the vision concerning Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, came to Peter (vv. <a href=Mat.htm#v16_16>16</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_17>17</a>). It was there also that the church was revealed and mentioned for the first time as the means of bringing in the kingdom of the heavens (vv. <a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>18</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_19>19</a>)."

Thus, to love and serve God with all our heart and soul indicates that we love and serve Him also with our spirit (<a href=Rom.htm#v1_9>Rom. 1:9</a>). Furthermore, according to <a href=Deu.htm#v6_5>6:5</a> we are to love Him also with all our might, that is, with our physical strength.
