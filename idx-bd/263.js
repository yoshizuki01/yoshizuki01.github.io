A tenth part of the city of Jerusalem fell because of the earthquake mentioned in this verse. In the last earthquake the city will be divided into three parts, as mentioned in <a href=Rev.htm#v16_19>16:19</a>."

BD["i7)\x97"]="<b>seven</b><br> &emsp; The seven plagues are the fury of God contained in the seven bowls (<a href=Rev.htm#v16_1>16:1</a>). These plagues constitute the third woe (<a href=Rev.htm#v11_14>11:14</a>), which comes at the sounding of the seventh trumpet (<a href=Rev.htm#v11_15>11:15</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v11_18>18</a>)."
BD["i1;\x97"]="<b>serpents</b><br> &emsp; The horses&rsquo; tails here, which are like serpents, are more poisonous than the locusts&rsquo; tails, which are like scorpions (<a href=Rev.htm#v9_10>v. 10</a>). The locusts only torment men for five months (vv. <a href=Rev.htm#v9_5>5</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v9_10>10</a>), whereas the horses kill the third part of men (vv. <a href=Rev.htm#v9_15>15</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v9_18>18</a>). This means that the woe of the sixth trumpet is more severe than that of the fifth."

BD["i42\x97"]="<b>kingdom</b><br> &emsp; The overcoming believers fight against Satan to usher in God&rsquo;s kingdom. The Lord taught us to pray for the coming of the kingdom (<a href=Mat.htm#v6_10>Matt. 6:10</a>). Along with our praying for the kingdom&rsquo;s coming, we need to fight for it. The coming of the kingdom has two aspects: the reality of the kingdom (<a href=Mat.htm#v5_3>Matt. 5:3</a>), which is in the proper church life today (<a href=Rom.htm#v14_17>Rom. 14:17</a>), and the manifestation of the kingdom in the millennium, which will be brought in through the overcoming believers.<br> &emsp; When the manifestation of the kingdom comes, the salvation of God will come in full with the kingdom. God&rsquo;s salvation has already been manifested to us today, but it will come in full in the kingdom age. It is the same with the power of God and the authority of His Christ. We have participated in God&rsquo;s power and Christ&rsquo;s authority today, but our full enjoyment of them will be in the kingdom age."
BD["i41\x9a"]="<b>Satan</b><br> &emsp; The word Satan means adversary. Satan is not only God&rsquo;s enemy outside God&rsquo;s kingdom but also God&rsquo;s adversary from within God&rsquo;s kingdom, rebelling against God."
