BD[")<.\x98"]="<b>love</b><br> &emsp; The mentioning of love here indicates that God&rsquo;s intention in giving His law to His chosen people was that they become His lovers (<a href=Deu.htm#v6_5>Deut. 6:5</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v22_35>Matt. 22:35</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v22_38>38</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v12_28>Mark 12:28</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v12_30>30</a>). In bringing His people out of Egypt and giving His law to them, God was courting them, wooing them, and seeking to win their affection. <a href=Jer.htm#v2_2>Jeremiah 2:2</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v31_32>31:32</a>; and <a href=Ezk.htm#v16_8>Ezekiel 16:8</a> indicate that the covenant enacted at the mountain of God through the giving of the law (<a href=Exo.htm#v24_7>24:7</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v24_8>8</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v34_27>34:27</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v34_28>28</a>) was an engagement covenant, in which God betrothed the children of Israel to Himself (cf. <a href=2Co.htm#v11_2>2&nbsp;Cor. 11:2</a>). The Ten Commandments, especially the first five, gave the terms of the engagement between God and His people. The highest function of the law is to bring God&rsquo;s chosen people into oneness with Him, as a wife is brought into oneness with her husband (cf. <a href=Gen.htm#v2_24>Gen. 2:24</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_17>Rev. 22:17</a>). In order for God and His people to be one, there must be a mutual love between them (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_21>John 14:21</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v14_23>23</a>). The love between God and His people unfolded in the Bible is primarily like the affectionate love between a man and a woman (<a href=Jer.htm#v2_2>Jer. 2:2</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v31_3>31:3</a>). As God&rsquo;s people love God and spend time to fellowship with Him in His word, God infuses them with His divine element, making them one with Him as His spouse, the same as He is in life, nature, and expression (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_18>Gen. 2:18</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_25>25</a> and <a href=GenN.htm#n2_18x1>notes</a>). See <a href=ExoN.htm#n19_8x1P2>note 8<sup>1</sup>, pars. 2</a> and <a href=ExoN.htm#n19_8x1P3>3</a>, in <a href=Exo.htm#v19>ch. 19</a>.<br> &emsp; The entire Bible is a divine romance, a record of how God courts His chosen people and eventually marries them (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_21>Gen. 2:21</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_24>24</a>; <a href=SoS.htm#v1_2>S.S. 1:2</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v1_4>4</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v54_5>Isa. 54:5</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v62_5>62:5</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v2_2>Jer. 2:2</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>, <a href=Jer.htm#v3_14>14</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v31_32>31:32</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v16_8>Ezek. 16:8</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v23_5>23:5</a>; <a href=Hos.htm#v2_7>Hosea 2:7</a>, <a href=Hos.htm#v2_19>19</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v9_15>Matt. 9:15</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_29>John 3:29</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v11_2>2&nbsp;Cor. 11:2</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v5_25>Eph. 5:25</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v5_32>32</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v19_7>Rev. 19:7</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>21:2</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_9>9</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_10>10</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_17>22:17</a>). When we as God&rsquo;s people enter into a love relationship with God, we receive His life, just as Eve received the life of Adam (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_21>Gen. 2:21</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_22>22</a>). It is this life that enables us to become one with God and makes Him one with us. We keep the law not by exercising our mind and will (cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v7_18>Rom. 7:18</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v7_25>25</a>) but by loving the Lord as our Husband and thereby partaking of His life and nature to become one with Him as His enlargement and expression."
