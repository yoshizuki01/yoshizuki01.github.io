The building of an altar and the offering of offerings on it signify the offering of Christ to God through the cross. In the church life, the first thing we must do is not to work for God but to go to the cross to be terminated; then we need to experience Christ and offer to God the Christ whom we have experienced in different aspects for God&rsquo;s satisfaction.

In the eyes of God, everything related to the Egyptian living, the living of the world, must be exposed and judged thoroughly.
