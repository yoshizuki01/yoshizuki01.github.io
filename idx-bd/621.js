This life was a part of the heavenly kingdom life on the Satan-darkened and man-inhabited earth. Apparently, the apostle, as a prisoner in bonds, had entered the region of the dark capital of the Satan-usurped empire; actually, as the ambassador of Christ with His authority (<a href=Eph.htm#v6_20>Eph. 6:20</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v28_18>Matt. 28:18</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v28_19>19</a>), he had come into another part of the participation in the Body life of Christ&rsquo;s church in the kingdom of God on earth. While he was suffering the persecution of religion in the empire of Satan, he was enjoying the church life in the kingdom of God. This was a comfort and an encouragement to him."

The more God&rsquo;s people enjoy Christ and experience Christ, the more they fulfill God&rsquo;s economy, and the more they are able to offer Christ to God as food.

In <a href=Num.htm#v28>Num. 28</a>&mdash;<a href=Num.htm#v29>29</a> there are three sections: the section pertaining to the daily life of God&rsquo;s people (see <a href=NumN.htm#n28_2x1>note 2<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Num.htm#v28>ch. 28</a>), the section pertaining to the church (from the Feast of Passover to the Feast of Pentecost, i.e., Weeks), and the section pertaining to the future of Israel (from the Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets to the Feast of Tabernacles). Each section is for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy. Because Christ is everything for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy, in each section He is God&rsquo;s food, God&rsquo;s satisfaction, served to God by His people and enjoyed with God by them. For eternity Christ will be God&rsquo;s satisfaction, and for eternity we will enjoy the Christ who satisfies God."
