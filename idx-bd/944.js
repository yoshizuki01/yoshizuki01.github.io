BD[")D9\x97"]="<b>stones</b><br> &emsp; The twelve precious stones on the breastplate, on which the names of the twelve tribes of Israel were engraved, signify all the redeemed and transformed people of God built together to become one entity. Precious stones are not created but are formed by the transforming of created things. This signifies that the church is produced by transformation, from something natural into something divine. As components of the church, the believers, who were created of dust (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_7>Gen. 2:7</a>), must be transformed in their human nature by and with the divine nature through the working of the Spirit (<a href=2Co.htm#v3_18>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18</a>) to become precious stones for God&rsquo;s eternal building (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_42>John 1:42</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_18>Rev. 21:18</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_20>20</a>)."

BD[")C<\x97"]="<b>oil</b><br> &emsp; The olive tree signifies Christ (cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v11_17>Rom. 11:17</a>), and the oil of beaten olives signifies the Spirit of Christ produced through Christ&rsquo;s process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_9>Rom. 8:9</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n8_9x4>note 4</a>)."

BD[")AB\x97"]="<b>rings</b><br> &emsp; As with the Ark, the four rings on the table signify the Spirit of Christ as the linking factor and power (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n25_12x1>note 12<sup>1</sup></a>). The oneness of the Spirit as a ring is a uniting bond with binding power (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_3>Eph. 4:3</a>). That the four rings were put on the four feet of the table signifies that Christ as our feast moves and follows us (cf. <a href=1Co.htm#v10_4>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:4</a>). That the rings, as holders for the poles, were close to the frame (<a href=Exo.htm#v25_27>v. 27</a>) signifies that both the linking and the moving are dependent on the connecting and strengthening (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n25_25x1>note 25<sup>1</sup></a>)."

BD["P6U\x8c"]="And when he came, he immediately approached Him and said, Rabbi! and kissed Him affectionately."
