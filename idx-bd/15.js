BD["i*0\x97"]="<b>Smyrna</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means myrrh, and myrrh in figure signifies suffering. Thus, the church in Smyrna was a suffering church. It signifies the church under the persecution of the Roman Empire from the latter part of the first century to the early part of the fourth century."
BD["i*/\x9a"]="<b>overcomes</b><br> &emsp; In these seven epistles, to overcome is to overcome the degraded situation of the churches. In this epistle, to overcome is to recover our first love toward the Lord and to hate the works of the Nicolaitans, the hierarchy that the Lord hates."

BD["i)3\x97"]="<b>send</b><br> &emsp; This book&rsquo;s being sent to the seven churches equals its being sent to the seven cities. This shows clearly that the practice of the church life in the early days was the practice of having one church for one city, one city with only one church. In no city was there more than one church. This is the local church, with the city, not the street or the area, as the unit. The jurisdiction of a local church should cover the whole city in which the church is located; it should not be greater or lesser than the boundary of the city. All the believers within that boundary should constitute the one unique local church within that city."
