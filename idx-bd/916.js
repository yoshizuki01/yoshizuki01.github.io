In His concept and desire, God wanted to be a Husband to Israel, and He wanted Israel to be a wife to Him, living in the most intimate contact with Him in this marvelous marriage union. In writing the books of history, Samuel put Judges after Joshua to show us the kind of life Israel lived toward her Husband. As unveiled in this book, Israel did not have a heart to be the wife of Jehovah. She forsook God as her Husband and went about as a harlot after other gods and worshipped them (<a href=Jdg.htm#v2_11>2:11</a>-<a href=Jdg.htm#v2_13>13</a>, <a href=Jdg.htm#v2_17>17</a>; <a href=Jdg.htm#v3_7>3:7</a>; <a href=Jdg.htm#v8_33>8:33</a>; <a href=Jdg.htm#v10_6>10:6</a>; cf. <a href=Jer.htm#v11_13>Jer. 11:13</a>; <a href=Ezk.htm#v16_25>Ezek. 16:25</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v16_26>26</a>; <a href=Hos.htm#v1_2>Hosea 1:2</a>; <a href=Hos.htm#v2_2>2:2</a>). After the account of Judah and Caleb in <a href=Jos.htm#v1_1>1:1</a>-<a href=Jos.htm#v20>20</a>, Israel&rsquo;s history as recorded in this book is full of the rottenness and corruption of a harlot. Whereas Joshua is the book of Israel&rsquo;s history full of the marvelous victories over the inhabitants of Canaan in the presence of Jehovah, Judges is the book of Israel&rsquo;s history full of miserable defeats under their enemies in the forsaking of Jehovah. This is the intrinsic significance of the book of Judges.<br> &emsp; The content of Judges consists of the children of Israel trusting in God, forsaking God, being defeated by their enemies, repenting to God in their misery, being delivered through the judges, and again becoming corrupted (<a href=Jdg.htm#v1_1>1:1</a>-<a href=Jdg.htm#v1_2>2</a>; <a href=Jdg.htm#v2_11>2:11</a>&mdash;<a href=Jdg.htm#v3_11>3:11</a>).

Because the offerers were sinful, in their coordinating with God they also offered twelve oxen, twelve rams, twelve lambs a year old, and their meal offering for the burnt offering; twelve male goats for a sin offering; and twenty-four oxen, sixty rams, sixty male goats, and sixty male lambs a year old for the peace offering (vv. <a href=Num.htm#v7_87>87</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v7_88>88</a>). These offerings signify Christ as our sin offering to redeem us from sin, Christ as our burnt offering for our living to God, and Christ as our peace offering, through which we and God enjoy Christ mutually in peace. All these offerings were for the worship of God, signifying that in order to worship God, we must offer ourselves to Him; then we must offer Christ as our sin offering, burnt offering, and peace offering so that we and God may enjoy Christ in mutuality and be satisfied with Him.<br> &emsp; Twelve is the number of absolute perfection and eternal completion in God&rsquo;s administration (see notes <a href=RevN.htm#n21_12x2>12<sup>2</sup></a>, <a href=RevN.htm#n21_16x2>16<sup>2</sup></a>, and <a href=RevN.htm#n21_17x1>17<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v21>Rev. 21</a>). The offerings were offered by the twelve tribes in twelve days, and the number of the sacrifices was twelve multiplied either by one (twelve), two (twenty-four), or five (sixty), signifying that the offering time, the offering people, and the offerings were absolutely perfect and eternally complete in God&rsquo;s administration."

Each of the offerings brought to God by the Nazarite was a type of Christ. The enjoyment of Christ as these offerings indicates the overcoming of natural affection, earthly pleasure, rebellion, and death (see notes <a href=NumN.htm#n6_3x1>3<sup>1</sup></a> through <a href=NumN.htm#n6_7x1>7<sup>1</sup></a>)."

In the Old Testament there was a distinction between the priests and the Levites. However, in the New Testament there is only one class, that of the priests (<a href=Rom.htm#v15_16>Rom. 15:16</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5</a>, <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_9>9</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v1_6>Rev. 1:6</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v5_10>5:10</a>), which includes the Levites. Hence, what the Levites did in the Old Testament in type, the believers as the New Testament priests should also do in reality. The fact that the service of the Levites was under the supervision of the priests indicates that when the New Testament priests do the outward Levitical work, they must do it under the supervision of the inward, spiritual view of the New Testament priesthood. The Levitical service should never be separated from the priestly view. The outward service must become a spiritual activity that ministers life to others."
