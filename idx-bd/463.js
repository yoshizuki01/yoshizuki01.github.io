Paul&rsquo;s move and activity were according to the Lord&rsquo;s instant leading.

Hence, the gospel of Christ is the gospel of His glory that illuminates and shines forth. Satan, the god of this age, has blinded the thoughts and the minds of the unbelievers so that the illumination of the gospel of Christ&rsquo;s glory might not shine into their hearts. This is similar to a camera lens&rsquo;s being covered so that the light cannot shine into the camera to bring in the image. It is also like a blind man, or a man with his eyes veiled, into whom the light of the sun is unable to shine."

To destroy the temple of God is to build with the worthless materials of wood, grass, and stubble, as described in <a href=1Co.htm#v3_12>v. 12</a>. This refers to certain Jewish believers who attempted to build the church with elements of Judaism, and to certain Greek believers who endeavored to bring philosophical elements into the building. All this tended to corrupt, ruin, defile, and mar the temple of God, that is, to destroy it. Using any doctrine that differs from the fundamental teachings of the apostles (<a href=Act.htm#v2_42>Acts 2:42</a>) or any ways and efforts that contradict God&rsquo;s nature, Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work, and the Spirit&rsquo;s transforming work is to corrupt, ruin, defile, mar, and destroy the church of God."

All these scriptural ordinances of the Old Testament dispensation became an obstacle to the spreading of the gospel to the Gentiles according to God&rsquo;s New Testament dispensation (<a href=Act.htm#v15_1>15:1</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v2_16>Col. 2:16</a>)."

Christ was made the Lamb of God that God may pass over us, the sinners, as portrayed in type by the passover in <a href=Exo.htm#v12>Exo. 12</a>. For the fulfillment of the type, Christ as the Passover lamb had to be killed on the day of the Passover.<br> &emsp; In the type, during the four days preceding the day of the Passover, the Passover lamb had to be examined in relation to its perfection (<a href=Exo.htm#v12_3>Exo. 12:3</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v12_6>6</a>). Before His crucifixion Christ came to Jerusalem for the last time, six days before the Passover (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_1>John 12:1</a>), and likewise was examined by the Jewish leaders for a few days (<a href=Mat.htm#v21_23>21:23</a>&mdash;<a href=Mat.htm#v22_46>22:46</a>).

These tribulations, along with the preaching of the gospel (<a href=Mat.htm#v24_14>v. 14</a>), are used by God to produce His many sons so that He can constitute the church in this age, accomplish the kingdom in the coming age, and produce the New Jerusalem in eternity as the ultimate consummation of the church and the kingdom that He may have an eternal expression in eternity future. <a href=Gal.htm#v4_19>Galatians 4:19</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v12_2>Rev. 12:2</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v12_5>5</a> confirm this viewpoint."
