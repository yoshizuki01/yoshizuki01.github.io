BD["(-)\x99"]="<b>likeness</b><br> &emsp; See <a href=GenN.htm#n1_26x3P1>note 26<sup>3</sup>, par. 1</a>, in <a href=Gen.htm#v1>ch. 1</a>."
BD["M)6\x97"]="<b>jealous</b><br> &emsp; Because the nations were sitting peacefully while Jerusalem was troubled, Jehovah was very jealous for Jerusalem. He was extremely angry with the nations, who were at ease, sitting still and quiet (vv. <a href=Zec.htm#v1_15>15a</a>, <a href=Zec.htm#v1_11>11</a>). God was only a little angry with Israel, but the nations, in their carrying out of God&rsquo;s punishment on Israel, dealt with Israel excessively (<a href=Zec.htm#v1_15>v. 15b</a>)."
BD["AQ*\x97"]="<b>ten</b><br> &emsp; The entrance of the porch measured fourteen cubits (<a href=Ezk.htm#v40_48>40:48</a>), the entrance to the outer temple (the Holy Place), ten cubits, and the entrance into the inner temple (the Holy of Holies), six cubits (<a href=Ezk.htm#v41_3>v. 3</a>). This indicates that the further inward we progress in our experience of God&rsquo;s building, the narrower the way becomes. The closer we are to the Lord, the more we will be restricted by Him."
BD["N)-\x97"]="<b>over</b><br> &emsp; Here over the territory of Israel means outside that territory. Even though the nation of Edom has been condemned and the people of Edom are the object of God&rsquo;s indignation, even in Edom, outside Israel, Jehovah will be magnified."
BD[">Y-\x97"]="<b>Me</b><br> &emsp; Verses <a href=Isa.htm#v49_5>5</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v49_9>9a</a> refer to Christ as the Servant of Jehovah (<a href=Isa.htm#v42_1>42:1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v42_7>7</a>). In this chapter whatever is spoken concerning Isaiah and Israel is also spoken concerning Christ. This means that Christ as the Servant of Jehovah fulfills all that Isaiah and Israel are as the servant of Jehovah."
BD["M-*\x97"]="<b>length</b><br> &emsp; The length of the flying scroll being twenty cubits and the breadth being ten cubits signifies the testimony of the law by two squares of ten cubits by ten cubits. The number two is the number for testimony (<a href=Deu.htm#v17_6>Deut. 17:6</a>), and the number ten signifies completion in fullness (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_10>Rev. 2:10</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n2_10x2>note 2</a>). Therefore, the law of God is a testimony to the whole world, and the two squares of ten cubits by ten cubits point to the completion in fullness of the law."
BD["AP-\x97"]="<b>wall</b><br> &emsp; The wall around the house is for separation, separating what belongs to God from what cannot belong to Him. The thickness and height of the wall are both six cubits; thus, a cross section of the wall is a square six cubits by six cubits. The number six signifies man, who was created on the sixth day. Hence, the wall with a square cross section of six cubits signifies Christ Himself as an upright, perfect, and complete man (cf. <a href=RevN.htm#n21_16x1>note 16<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v21>Rev. 21</a>). Such a Christ is the separating line of God&rsquo;s building. Only what is included in Christ belongs to God&rsquo;s interests and God&rsquo;s building (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_21>Eph. 2:21</a>)."
BD["(+/\x99"]="<b>fig</b><br> &emsp; Fig leaves are of the vegetable life, which has no blood for redemption (cf. <a href=Heb.htm#v9_22>Heb. 9:22</a>). The coverings of fig leaves represent man&rsquo;s own works in attempting to cover his sinfulness. Such works are inadequate to cover man&rsquo;s nakedness that he might be justified, accepted, before God (cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v3_20>Rom. 3:20a</a>). See notes <a href=GenN.htm#n3_21x1>21<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=GenN.htm#n3_21x2>21<sup>2</sup></a>."
BD["AJ?\x97"]="<b>David</b><br> &emsp; Referring to Christ, who is the real David (<a href=Mat.htm#v12_3>Matt. 12:3</a>), the real Shepherd of God&rsquo;s flock (<a href=Psa.htm#v23>Psa. 23</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v10_11>John 10:11</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v13_20>Heb. 13:20</a>) and the King (<a href=Ezk.htm#v34_24>v. 24</a>) of God&rsquo;s people (<a href=Isa.htm#v9_7>Isa. 9:7</a>; <a href=Hos.htm#v3_5>Hosea 3:5</a>; <a href=Mic.htm#v5_2>Micah 5:2</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v1_32>Luke 1:32</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v1_33>33</a>)."

BD["(*2\x99"]="<b>four</b><br> &emsp; The number four signifies man, the creature (<a href=Ezk.htm#v1_5>Ezek. 1:5</a>). The one river becoming four branches signifies that the river flows out of the unique God (signified by the number one) as the source and center to reach man in every direction."
BD["M+0\x97"]="<b>servant</b><br> &emsp; This refers to Zerubbabel, who is a type of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah, the Shoot of David (<a href=Jer.htm#v23_5>Jer. 23:5</a>), in His humanity and royal faithfulness (<a href=Zec.htm#v6_12>6:12</a>). Although he was not a king but was a governor in the position of a king (<a href=Hag.htm#v1_1>Hag. 1:1</a>), Zerubbabel was nevertheless a descendant, a shoot, of the royal family of David. As such, he typifies Christ."
