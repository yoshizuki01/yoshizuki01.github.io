This is a divine traffic in two directions. The anointing brings God to us in Christ and through Christ for our participation in the divine element; the incense is our going to God with Christ and as Christ in prayer for God&rsquo;s enjoyment. This kind of prayer simultaneously satisfies God with a sweet fragrance and carries out God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s administration (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n30_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a>)."

Wheat flour is produced by the grinding of wheat grains, and oil and wine, by the pressing of olives and grapes, respectively. Both grinding and pressing signify the operation of the cross.<br> &emsp; All the items offered to God as His food were things grown, raised, reaped, and processed by the children of Israel. Hence, they were subjective to the children of Israel. This indicates that the Christ whom we offer to God as His food must be subjective to us, the produce of our living Him and experiencing Him in all the aforementioned aspects, based on our daily offering of Him as our sin offering (<a href=Exo.htm#v29_36>v. 36</a>)."
