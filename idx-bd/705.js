Although Jeremiah was preserved, because of the different opinions among the people concerning Jeremiah, nothing was attained toward the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s goal. All the different opinions distracted the people from God and kept them away from His dispensing.

Human government that was formed in opposition to God began with Nimrod, the first type of Antichrist and the founder of Nineveh (the capital of Assyria) and Babel, which issued in Babylon (<a href=Gen.htm#v10_8>Gen. 10:8</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v10_11>11</a> and <a href=GenN.htm#n10_8x1>note 8<sup>1</sup></a>). Throughout the centuries human government, including the empires of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome, has been used by God to carry out His work of chastising Israel. Eventually, the entire human government&mdash;the four kinds of locusts mentioned in <a href=Joe.htm#v1>Joel 1</a> and the four sections of the great human image described in <a href=Dan.htm#v2>Dan. 2</a>&mdash;will be smashed by a single stone, Christ as the stone cut out without hands that will become a great mountain and fill the whole earth (<a href=Dan.htm#v2_34>Dan. 2:34</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v2_35>35</a> and <a href=DanN.htm#n2_34x1>notes</a>). It is in this way that Christ will save Israel from Assyria.<br> &emsp; In relation to Christ&rsquo;s coming and the restoration of Israel, Assyria equals Rome, and Nimrod equals Antichrist. Eventually, Israel will be invaded by Antichrist, the last Caesar of the Roman Empire, and his armies. At this juncture Christ will come to destroy Antichrist and his armies and to save Israel (<a href=Zec.htm#v14_2>Zech. 14:2</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v14_7>7</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v19_19>Rev. 19:19</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v19_21>21</a>). At that time, the great human image will be crushed by the stone cut out without hands (<a href=Dan.htm#v2_31>Dan. 2:31</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v2_35>35</a>). Assyria, Nimrod, the empires of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome, and Antichrist will be no more, and the entire earth will become the kingdom of God for eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v11_15>Rev. 11:15</a>). Then all Jehovah&rsquo;s elect will enjoy Him. This is God&rsquo;s comfort to Israel, a comfort that is a matter of restoration (<a href=Act.htm#v3_20>Acts 3:20</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v3_21>21</a>)."
