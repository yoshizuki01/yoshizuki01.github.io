Here and in <a href=Deu.htm#v33_8>Deut. 33:8</a> and <a href=Deu.htm#v33_10>10</a>, God&rsquo;s judgments, referring to God&rsquo;s law with its verdicts and judgments (see <a href=LukN.htm#n1_6x4>note 6<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=Luk.htm#v1>Luke 1</a>), are related to the Urim and the Thummim. According to the Old Testament, the Urim and the Thummim added to the breastplate were a means for God to speak to His people to indicate to them His leading (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n28_30xa>references in 30<sup>a</sup></a>). God&rsquo;s leading through the breastplate always involved a judgment. God&rsquo;s law includes His judgments, and these judgments become God&rsquo;s leading. In spiritual experience, in order to know God&rsquo;s leading we must judge whatever is of the flesh, the self, the old man, and the world. In <a href=Rom.htm#v8_14>Rom. 8:14</a> the leading of the Spirit, as the reality of God&rsquo;s leading through the breastplate, issues from, and is the totality of, all the judgments in vv. <a href=Rom.htm#v8_1>1</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_13>13</a> of that chapter (see <a href=RomN.htm#n8_14x1>note 14<sup>1</sup></a> there).<br> &emsp; The fact that God&rsquo;s speaking as His leading was through the breastplate signifies that God makes His leading known to His people through the church. The Lord&rsquo;s speaking through the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim required the making of the breastplate with the twelve precious stones engraved with the names of the children of Israel and the bearing of the breastplate on the heart of the high priest. In the same principle, God&rsquo;s speaking today through the church with Christ as the Illuminator (Urim) and Perfecter (Thummim) requires the building up of the church with the believers as transformed, transparent precious stones who have been inscribed with Christ as the letters of the spiritual alphabet (<a href=2Co.htm#v3_3>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:3</a>) and the bearing of the church on the hearts of the leading ones."
