If man eats the tree of life, he will receive God as life and fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose; if he eats the tree of knowledge, he will receive Satan as death and be usurped by him for his purpose.<br> &emsp; God&rsquo;s forbidding commandment given as a warning to man indicates (1) God&rsquo;s greatness in creating man with a free will that man may choose God willingly and not under coercion; (2) God&rsquo;s love for man; and (3) God&rsquo;s desire that man would eat the tree of life to receive God into him as life."

BD["*)*\x97"]="<b>offering</b><br> &emsp; Heb. qorban, meaning a present, or a gift. Strictly, the offerings are not sacrifices but presents given to God by the appreciators of Christ. Sacrifices are for redemption, for propitiation, whereas presents are gifts for intimate fellowship between us and God. The children of Israel were to labor on the good land and then offer to God as presents the produce they enjoyed and appreciated. Likewise, we should endeavor to experience and enjoy Christ and then offer Christ to God as a present with much appreciation. The tabernacle is for God to dwell in, and the offerings are for God to enjoy with us through our appreciation and presentation.<br> &emsp; Exodus ends with the erecting of the tabernacle (<a href=Exo.htm#v40>Exo. 40</a>), and Leviticus begins with the offerings (chs. <a href=Lev.htm#v1>1</a>&mdash;<a href=Lev.htm#v7>7</a>), implying a direct continuation between the two books. Both the tabernacle and the offerings are types of Christ. Through incarnation Christ came to be the tabernacle (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>). This same Christ is also the Lamb of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>John 1:29</a>), the totality, the aggregate, of all the offerings (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_5>Heb. 10:5</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v10_10>10</a>). Christ came in incarnation to bring God to us (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>John 1:1</a>&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v13_38>13:38</a>), and He passed through crucifixion and resurrection to bring us to God (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_1>John 14:1</a>&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v21_25>21:25</a>), making God one with us and us one with God. The tabernacle signifies that God is in Christ that we may contact, experience, enter into, and join to God. The offerings signify God in Christ for us to enjoy and even to eat, digest, and assimilate (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_53>John 6:53</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v6_58>58</a>) that we may be mingled with God. The way to enjoy Christ as the reality of all the offerings is to contact Him and take Him in as the Spirit of reality (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_63>John 6:63</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v14_16>14:16</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v14_18>18</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v14_20>20</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>).<br> &emsp; According to Leviticus, there are five main kinds of offerings: the burnt offering (<a href=Lev.htm#v1_1>1:1</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v1_17>17</a>), the meal offering (<a href=Lev.htm#v2_1>2:1</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v2_16>16</a>), the peace offering (<a href=Lev.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v3_17>17</a>), the sin offering (<a href=Lev.htm#v4_1>4:1</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v4_35>35</a>), and the trespass offering (<a href=Lev.htm#v5_1>5:1</a>&mdash;<a href=Lev.htm#v6_7>6:7</a>). The functions of these offerings were (1) as sacrifices for sin, to make expiation for God&rsquo;s people by appeasing the situation between God and His people, (2) as gifts to please God, and (3) as food for God and for His serving ones, the priests."
