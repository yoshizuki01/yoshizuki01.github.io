In dealing with the fasting and dissenting disciples of John, who were of the new religion, He revealed Himself as the Bridegroom who had come to take the bride. John the Baptist had told his disciples that Christ was the Bridegroom who had come to take the bride (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_25>John 3:25</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_29>29</a>). Now Christ, the kingly Savior, reminded some of them of this. Both a physician and a bridegroom are pleasant persons. The kingly Savior first healed His followers, and then made them the sons of the bridechamber; eventually, He will make them His bride. They should have laid hold of Him not only as their Physician, that their life might be recovered, but also as their Bridegroom, that they might have the enjoyment of living in His presence. They were with Him at a joyful wedding, not without Him at a mournful funeral. How then could they fast and not feast before Him? The dissenting question from John&rsquo;s disciples indicated that some of them had fallen into a new religion and had rejected the kingly Savior.<br> &emsp; The question from John&rsquo;s disciples seemed to relate to doctrine. However, the Lord answered not with a doctrine but with a person, the most pleasant person, the Bridegroom. The religious people always care for their doctrine, asking &ldquo;why&rdquo; in a doctrinal way. But Christ cares only for Himself. The living and walk of His followers should be regulated and directed only by Himself and His presence, not by any doctrine."
