BD["f),\x97"]="<b>rejoiced</b><br> &emsp; The truth concerning the person of Christ is the basic and central element of John&rsquo;s mending ministry. When he found the children of the faithful believer walking in truth, he rejoiced greatly (<a href=3Jo.htm#v3>3&nbsp;John 3</a>-<a href=3Jo.htm#v4>4</a>)."
BD["e-)\x97"]="<b>believes</b><br> &emsp; The Gnostics and the Cerinthians did not believe that Jesus and the Christ were identical (see notes <a href=1JoN.htm#n2_22x1>22<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=1Jo.htm#v2>ch. 2</a> and <a href=1JoN.htm#n4_3x1>3<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=1Jo.htm#v4>ch. 4</a>). Hence, they were not the children of God, were not begotten of God. But whoever believes that the man Jesus is the Christ, God incarnate (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>John 1:1</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>14</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v20_31>20:31</a>), has been begotten of God and has become a child of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_12>John 1:12</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_13>13</a>). Such a one loves God the Father, who has begotten him, and also loves the brother, who has been begotten of the same Father. This explains, confirms, and strengthens the word in the preceding verses (<a href=1Jo.htm#v4_20>4:20</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v4_21>21</a>)."
BD["a55\x97"]="<b>outside</b><br> &emsp; Outside the camp and within the veil (<a href=Heb.htm#v6_19>6:19</a>) are two very striking points in this book. To enter within the veil means to enter into the Holy of Holies, where the Lord is enthroned in glory, and to go outside the camp means to come out of religion, whence the Lord was cast in rejection. This signifies that we must be in our spirit, where experientially the practical Holy of Holies is today, and outside religion, where the practical camp is today. The more we are in our spirit, enjoying the heavenly Christ, the more we will come outside the camp of religion, following the suffering Jesus. Being in our spirit to enjoy the glorified Christ enables us to come outside the camp of religion to follow the rejected Jesus. The more we remain in our spirit to contact the heavenly Christ, who is in glory, the more we will go forth outside the camp of religion unto the lowly Jesus to suffer with Him. By contacting Christ in the heavens and enjoying His glorification, we are energized to take the narrow pathway of the cross on earth and bear the reproach of Jesus. First, this book gives us a clear vision of the heavenly Christ and the heavenly Holy of Holies, and then it shows us how to walk on the earth in the pathway of the cross, i.e., how to go forth unto Jesus outside the camp, outside religion, bearing His reproach. Even Moses, after the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf (<a href=Exo.htm#v32>Exo. 32</a>), moved to a place outside the camp, where everyone who sought the Lord went to meet with him; for both the Lord&rsquo;s presence and the Lord&rsquo;s speaking were there (<a href=Exo.htm#v33_7>Exo. 33:7</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v33_11>11</a>). We must go outside the camp that we may enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence and hear His speaking. All these things are necessary for the practical and proper church life.<br> &emsp; The Holy of Holies, the pathway of the cross (signified by the going forth unto Jesus outside the camp, bearing His reproach), and the kingdom are three crucial matters set forth in this book. The Holy of Holies with its rich supply enables us to take the narrow, difficult pathway of the cross, and the pathway of the cross ushers us into the kingdom in its manifestation that we may obtain the reward of glory."

BD["a48\x97"]="<b>birthright</b><br> &emsp; Esau&rsquo;s birthright as the firstborn son of Isaac was the double portion of land, the priesthood, and the kingship. Because of Esau&rsquo;s profaneness in giving up his birthright, the double portion of land was given to Joseph (<a href=1Ch.htm#v5_1>1&nbsp;Chron. 5:1</a>-<a href=1Ch.htm#v5_2>2</a>), the priesthood was passed to Levi (<a href=Deu.htm#v33_8>Deut. 33:8</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v33_10>10</a>), and the kingship was assigned to Judah (<a href=Gen.htm#v49_10>Gen. 49:10</a>; <a href=1Ch.htm#v5_2>1&nbsp;Chron. 5:2</a>).<br> &emsp; We Christians, born of God, are the firstfruits of His creatures (<a href=Jam.htm#v1_18>James 1:18</a>) that He has reaped in His creation. In that sense we are the firstborn sons of God. Hence, the church, composed of us, is called the church of the firstborn (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_23>v. 23</a>). As the firstborn sons of God, we have the birthright. This includes the inheritance of the earth (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_5>2:5</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v2_6>6</a>), the priesthood (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>Rev. 20:6</a>), and the kingship (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>Rev. 20:4</a>), which will be the main blessings in the coming kingdom and which the profane, world-loving-and-seeking Christians will lose at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. Eventually, this birthright will be a reward given to the overcoming Christians in the millennial kingdom. Any worldly enjoyment, even one meal, could cause us to forfeit this birthright of ours. After such a serious warning, if the Hebrew believers had still preferred to indulge in &ldquo;one meal&rdquo; of their old religion, they would have missed the full enjoyment of Christ and would have lost the kingdom rest with all its blessings.<br> &emsp; Esau was not the only one who lost his birthright (<a href=Gen.htm#v25_29>Gen. 25:29</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v25_34>34</a>); Reuben was another who lost the blessing of the birthright (<a href=Gen.htm#v49_3>Gen. 49:3</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v49_4>4</a>; <a href=1Ch.htm#v5_1>1&nbsp;Chron. 5:1</a>). Esau lost it because of his lust in eating. Reuben lost it because of the defilement of his lust. Both cases should be warnings to us. The word lest there be any fornicator in this verse might have been written with Reuben as the background.<br> &emsp; Actually, what we are privileged to enjoy in Christ is the foretaste of the blessings in the coming kingdom. The proper enjoyment of this foretaste will usher us into the full taste of the kingdom blessings. If we do not enjoy Christ today as our good land, as defined in <a href=HebN.htm#n4_9x1>note 9<sup>1</sup></a> of <a href=Heb.htm#v4>ch. 4</a>, how can we enter into His rest in the kingdom and inherit the earth with Him? If we do not exercise our priesthood today to contact Him and prayerfully minister to Him, how can we fulfill our priestly duty in the kingdom? If we do not exercise our spirit with the God-given authority to rule our self, our flesh, our entire being, and the enemy with all his power of darkness today, how can we be Christ&rsquo;s co-kings and rule the nations with Him in His kingdom (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_26>Rev. 2:26</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v2_27>27</a>)? Our enjoyment of Christ and the practice of the priesthood and kingship today are the preparation and qualification for our participating in Christ&rsquo;s kingdom tomorrow!"

In both his Epistles, which also are a part of the apostles&rsquo; teaching and are constituents of the New Testament, Peter referred repeatedly to the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament apostles (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_10>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:10</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_12>12</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v1_12>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:12</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_21>21</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v3_2>3:2</a>). Here he referred to the apostle Paul in the strongest way, saying that Paul in all his writings spoke some things that are hard to understand, concerning the things of which Peter spoke in his writing, and that to twist Paul&rsquo;s writings is equivalent to twisting the Scriptures as the heretics do, which results in destruction, that is, in being judged by the Lord at His coming back.
