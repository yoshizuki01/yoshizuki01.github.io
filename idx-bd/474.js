The Lord will say that they are His people, and they will say that the Lord is their God (<a href=Zec.htm#v13_9>v. 9b</a>). They will be saved into the enjoyment of the riches of the Triune God, first in the millennium to be the priests to teach the nations (<a href=Zec.htm#v8_20>8:20</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v8_23>23</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v2_3>Isa. 2:3</a>) and then in the New Jerusalem to participate in all the blessings God has ordained in eternity and for eternity (see <a href=Rev.htm#v21_12>Rev. 21:12b</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n21_12x4P2>note 4, par. 2</a>).

It was through that census that Christ was born in Bethlehem (<a href=Luk.htm#v2_4>Luke 2:4</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v2_7>7</a>) to fulfill the prophecy concerning His birth (<a href=Mic.htm#v5_2>Micah 5:2</a>).

Then, because of Herod&rsquo;s persecution He was taken to Egypt (vv. <a href=Mat.htm#v2_13>13</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v2_15>15</a>), and subsequently He was brought back to the land of Israel (vv. <a href=Mat.htm#v2_19>19</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v2_21>21</a>). Because of Archelaus&rsquo;s reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, Christ was brought to Nazareth, a despised city of Galilee (vv. <a href=Mat.htm#v2_22>22</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v2_23>23</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_45>John 1:45</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_46>46</a>), and was raised there. He was born in the esteemed town of Bethlehem but grew up in the despised city of Nazareth. Hence, He was called a Nazarene. To follow Christ requires that we heed not only the Scriptures concerning Him but also the instant leadings, such as those Joseph had in his dreams. Caring only for the Scriptures while neglecting the instant leadings may cause us to miss Christ, as did the Jewish priests and scribes. Heeding the instant leadings requires a seeking heart."
