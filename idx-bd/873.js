The first trumpet is a judgment on the earth, including the trees and all the grass, as occurred in Egypt (<a href=Exo.htm#v9_18>Exo. 9:18</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v9_25>25</a>); the second, a judgment on the sea, including the living creatures and ships; the third, a judgment on the rivers and springs of waters, as occurred in Egypt (<a href=Exo.htm#v7_17>Exo. 7:17</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v7_21>21</a>); the fourth, a judgment on the sun, the moon, and the stars that they may be darkened, as also occurred in Egypt (<a href=Exo.htm#v10_21>Exo. 10:21</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v10_23>23</a>). By the judgments of these four trumpets, the third part of the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the hosts in the heavens are damaged and are thus caused to be no longer good for man&rsquo;s living. At the sixth seal, before the seven trumpets, there was already a judgment on the earth and on the hosts of the heavens (<a href=Rev.htm#v6_12>6:12</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v6_14>14</a>). The extent of the damage caused by that judgment was not as definite as the extent of the damage caused by the first four trumpets. At the seventh trumpet, through the seven bowls there will be further judgments on the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun (<a href=Rev.htm#v16_1>16:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v16_21>21</a>).
