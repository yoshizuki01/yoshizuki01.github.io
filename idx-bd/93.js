Merely being the seed of Abraham did not constitute them true Jews. Those who are the children of the flesh are not the children of God (<a href=Rom.htm#v9_7>Rom. 9:7</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v9_8>8</a>)."

BD["i,+\x9a"]="<b>emerald</b><br> &emsp; The rainbow around God&rsquo;s throne is like an emerald in appearance. An emerald is a precious stone whose grass-green color signifies the lives on earth. This indicates that as God is executing His judgment upon the earth, He will remember His covenant and will spare some of the lives on earth, as indicated in <a href=Gen.htm#v9_11>Gen. 9:11</a>."

On one hand, as the High Priest, He is interceding in the heavens for the churches (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_24>Heb. 9:24</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v7_25>7:25</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v7_26>26</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_34>Rom. 8:34</a>), and on the other hand, He is walking in the midst of the churches to care for them. To participate in His move and enjoy His care, we must be in the churches."

Psalms <a href=Psa.htm#v146>146</a>&mdash;<a href=Psa.htm#v150>150</a> each begin and end with the word Hallelujah. These five psalms may be considered the consummate praises, corresponding with the praises at the end of Revelation (<a href=Rev.htm#v19_1>Rev. 19:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v19_6>6</a>). <a href=Psa.htm#v146>Psalm 146</a> concerns the praising of Jehovah for His reigning from Zion (<a href=Psa.htm#v146_10>v. 10</a>).<br> &emsp; In the Septuagint there are superscriptions which indicate that <a href=Psa.htm#v146>Psa. 146</a>&mdash;<a href=Psa.htm#v148>148</a> were written by Haggai and Zechariah. This would have been after their return from captivity. The return of God&rsquo;s people from captivity was a great release and restoration (see Ezra and Nehemiah)."
BD["i+/\x97"]="<b>Philadelphia</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means brotherly love. As a sign, the church in Philadelphia prefigures the proper church life recovered by the brothers raised up by the Lord in England in the early part of the nineteenth century. Just as the reformed church, prefigured by the church in Sardis, was a reaction to the apostate Catholic Church, prefigured by the church in Thyatira, so the church of brotherly love was a reaction to the dead reformed church. This reaction will continue as an anti-testimony to both apostate Catholicism and degraded Protestantism until the Lord comes back."
