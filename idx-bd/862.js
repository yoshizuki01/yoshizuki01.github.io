BD["i>=\x97"]="<b>grace</b><br> &emsp; After seeing all the visions and hearing all the prophecies in this book, we still need the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Only the grace of the Lord Jesus can enable us to live and walk according to these visions and prophecies. Not only this book but also the entire Bible closes with this grace, the grace that enables us to experience the all-inclusive Christ and participate in the Triune God that we may become His eternal corporate expression for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose, that He and we may enjoy absolute satisfaction and complete rest mutually for eternity."

BD["i=\@\x97"]="<b>nations</b><br> &emsp; At the end of this age a great part of the inhabitants of the earth will be killed as a result of the sixth and seventh trumpets. The rest will be judged by Christ at the throne of His glory when He comes back to earth. The condemned ones, the &ldquo;goats,&rdquo; will be cursed and will perish in the lake of fire, while the justified ones, the &ldquo;sheep,&rdquo; will be blessed and will inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world (<a href=Mat.htm#v25_31>Matt. 25:31</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v25_46>46</a>). Unlike the New Testament believers, the &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; will not be saved and regenerated; they will only be restored to the original state of man as he was created by God. They will be the nations as citizens of the millennial kingdom, in which the overcoming believers will be the kings (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>20:4</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>) and the saved remnant of Israel will be the priests (<a href=Zec.htm#v8_20>Zech. 8:20</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v8_23>23</a>). After the millennial kingdom, a part of these nations, deceived by the devil, will rebel against the Lord and will be consumed by fire from heaven (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_7>20:7</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_9>9</a>). The rest will be transferred to the new earth to be the nations, which will live around the New Jerusalem and walk by its light. They will be the peoples mentioned in vv. <a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>3</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v21_4>4</a>. They, as created but unregenerated men, will be maintained to live forever in their created state through the healing of the leaves of the tree of life (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_2>22:2</a>). Even for them there will be no more death (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_4>v. 4</a>). Under the shining of the New Jerusalem with the divine glory, neither will they be in darkness."
