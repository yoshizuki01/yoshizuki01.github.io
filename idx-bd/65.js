This kind of persecution was considered by Peter in this book as God&rsquo;s judgment, which is according to the government of God and which begins from the house of God (<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_17>v. 17</a>). The gospel was preached to these dead believers while they were living, that they might, on the one hand, be judged, dealt with, by God in the flesh according to men through the opposers&rsquo; persecution, but, on the other hand, live in the spirit according to God by believing in Christ. This shows how strict and serious is the judgment of God in His governmental administration. If the believers, who have been obedient to the gospel, are dealt with by God&rsquo;s governmental judgment, how much more will those who oppose the gospel and slander the believers be judged by God&rsquo;s dealing (vv. !"

In the new covenant four blessings are promised: (1) propitiation for our unrighteousnesses and the forgetting (forgiveness) of our sins (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_12>v. 12</a>); (2) the imparting of the law of life by the imparting of the divine life into us (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_10>v. 10a</a>); (3) the privilege of having God as our God and of being His people&mdash;the divine life&rsquo;s enabling us to participate in the enjoyment of God in fellowship with Him (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_10>v. 10b</a>); and (4) the function of life that enables us to know Him in the inward way of life (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_11>v. 11</a>).

This is continued in 2&nbsp;Peter. Under God&rsquo;s government the fallen angels were caught and are being kept for judgment (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_4>v. 4</a>), and the age of the deluge and the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were all judged (vv. <a href=2Pe.htm#v2_5>5</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_9>9</a>). But God will mete out especially serious judgment to the New Testament heretics (<a href=2Pe.htm#v2_10>v. 10</a>). And all the ungodly will be judged and destroyed in the day when the heavens and the earth are burned by fire (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_7>3:7</a>).
