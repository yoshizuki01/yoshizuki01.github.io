His ministry completes the revelation concerning the all-inclusive Christ and His universal Body, the church as His fullness to express Him. Concerning the church as the Body of Christ there are two sides: life and practice. From Romans through 2&nbsp;Thessalonians a full revelation is given concerning the life of the church, including the nature, responsibility, and function of the church. Now, from 1&nbsp;Timothy through Philemon a detailed revelation concerning the practice of the church is presented. This pertains to the administration and shepherding of a local church. For this, the first thing needed is to terminate the different teachings of the dissenters, which distract the saints from the central line and ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (vv. <a href=1Ti.htm#v1_4>4</a>-<a href=1Ti.htm#v1_6>6</a>).
