BD["SDG\x98"]="<b>kingdom</b><br> &emsp; The kingdom of God is one of the matters emphasized in this book. Luke&rsquo;s writing here both begins (<a href=Act.htm#v1_3>1:3</a>) and ends with the kingdom of God.<br> &emsp; This book was not actually ended; rather, it was left open that more may be added. The reason for this must have been that the work of the Holy Spirit in preaching Christ for His propagation, multiplication, and spread through the believers of Christ was not yet completed and needed to be continued for a long period of time. Such an evangelistic work for Christ&rsquo;s propagation, multiplication, and spread is according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy for the producing of many sons for God (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>Rom. 8:29</a>) that they might be the members of Christ to constitute His Body (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_5>Rom. 12:5</a>) for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s eternal plan and the fulfillment of His eternal will. This is revealed in detail in the twenty-one Epistles and the book of Revelation, which follow this book. The church produced by Christ&rsquo;s propagation and multiplication is the sphere in which God is expressed and in which He reigns in Christ; hence, the church becomes the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God, along with Christ&rsquo;s propagation and multiplication, grows out of and spreads from God&rsquo;s life. Acts is a record of the spreading of Christ; it is also a record of the kingdom of God, because the kingdom of God is the expansion of Christ. The gospel that is widely preached in this book is the very Christ as the gospel (<a href=Act.htm#v5_42>5:42</a>), the gospel of Christ, and it is also the kingdom of God as the gospel (<a href=Act.htm#v8_12>8:12</a>), the gospel of the kingdom of God. The preaching of such a gospel will continue and advance until the whole earth becomes the kingdom of Christ (<a href=Rev.htm#v11_15>Rev. 11:15</a>).<br> &emsp; In the four Gospels God was incarnated, passed through human living, died, and resurrected, thus completing Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God (<a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>). In Acts this embodiment of God, as the life-giving Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>), spreads Christ into His believers, i.e., works the processed Triune God into His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people to make them the constituents of the church, through which God may be expressed. The ultimate issue of the church will be the New Jerusalem in eternity future as God&rsquo;s full and eternal expression, which will also be God&rsquo;s eternal kingdom as the sphere in which He reigns in His divine life in eternity forever and ever. This should be the reality and goal of all gospel preaching today."

The human concept of the holy writers uplifts the law to the extent that they treasured the law and desired to remain in it for their whole life.
