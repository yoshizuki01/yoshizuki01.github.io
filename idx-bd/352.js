The basic fact of our divine birth prevents us, the regenerated ones, from practicing sin (<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_9>3:9</a> and <a href=1JoN.htm#n3_9x2>note 2</a>), that is, from living in sin (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_2>Rom. 6:2</a>).

BD["e+\@\x97"]="<b>abides</b><br> &emsp; This verse is the conclusion of this section, which begins in <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_28>2:28</a>, on our abiding in the Lord according to the teaching of the divine anointing, as unfolded in the preceding section (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_20>2:20</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_27>27</a>). This section reveals that abiding in the Lord is the living of the children of God by His eternal life as the divine seed (vv. <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_15>15</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_9>9</a>, and <a href=1JoN.htm#n2_29x7>note 29<sup>7</sup></a> in <a href=1Jo.htm#v2>ch. 2</a>), which grows in the practicing of the righteousness of their begetting God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_29>2:29</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_7>3:7</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_10>10</a>) and the love of their begetting Father (vv. <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_10>10</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_11>11</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_14>14</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_23>23</a>). Such an abiding and its bases&mdash;the divine birth and the divine life as the divine seed&mdash;are mysterious yet real in the Spirit."
