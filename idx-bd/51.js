BD["`)8\x97"]="<b>No</b><br> &emsp; This short Epistle serves the special purpose of showing us the equality, in God&rsquo;s eternal life and divine love, of all the members in the Body of Christ. In the semisavage age of Paul, the life of Christ had annulled, among the believers, the strong institution of slavery. Since the sentiment of the love of the Christian fellowship was so powerful and prevailing that the evil social order among fallen mankind was spontaneously ignored, any need for institutional emancipation was obviated. Because of the divine birth and because they were living by the divine life, all the believers in Christ had equal status in the church, which was the new man in Christ and in which there was no discrimination between free and bond (<a href=Col.htm#v3_10>Col. 3:10</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v3_11>11</a>). This was based on three facts: (1) Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross abolished the ordinances of the different ways of life, for the creating of the one new man (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_15>Eph. 2:15</a>); (2) we all were baptized into Christ and were made one in Him without any differences (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_27>Gal. 3:27</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v3_28>28</a>); and (3) in the new man Christ is all and in all (<a href=Col.htm#v3_11>Col. 3:11</a>). Such a life with such a love in equal fellowship is well able to maintain good order in the church (in Titus), carry out God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church (in 1&nbsp;Timothy), and stand against the tide of the church&rsquo;s decline (in 2&nbsp;Timothy). It is of the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty that in the arrangement of the New Testament this Epistle was positioned after the three preceding books."

Instead of speaking concerning the law, these psalms are related to the matter of captivity. The people of Israel loved the law, but because they transgressed the law, even going so far as to turn from God and worship idols (<a href=Jer.htm#v2_13>Jer. 2:13</a>), God sent them into captivity in a land of idols. As the people were suffering in captivity, they could not forget Zion and Jerusalem, which were signs, symbols, of the very God whom they worshipped. When the people of Israel were captured, they were in a downward situation. To return to Jerusalem and to Zion was to be in an upward situation, to &ldquo;go up&rdquo; (<a href=Psa.htm#v122_4>122:4</a>). Jerusalem was built on Mount Zion. Therefore, when the people journeyed to Jerusalem, they had to ascend, and as they were ascending they sang a song of ascents."
