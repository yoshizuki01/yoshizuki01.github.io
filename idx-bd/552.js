BD["R))\x97"]="<b>In</b><br> &emsp; In the beginning means in eternity past. As the introduction to this Gospel, this chapter begins in eternity past with God, who had divinity but not humanity (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>v. 1</a>); it then passes through His creation of all things (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_3>v. 3</a>), His incarnation (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>v. 14</a>), His becoming the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>v. 29</a>), and His being the Spirit who causes the believers to be transformed into living stones for His building (vv. <a href=Joh.htm#v1_32>32</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_42>42</a>), and continues all the way to eternity future, in which the Son of Man, who has both divinity and humanity, is the center for the communication between heaven and earth and for the union of God and man in eternity. After this, <a href=Joh.htm#v2>ch. 2</a> shows that the principle of the Triune God as life is to change death into life (<a href=Joh.htm#v2_1>2:1</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v2_11>11</a>) and that the purpose of life is to build the house, the temple, of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v2_13>2:13</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v2_22>22</a>). In chs. <a href=Joh.htm#v3>3</a>&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v11>11</a>, nine cases are given to illustrate how God as life meets the different needs of different kinds of people. As a result, in the beginning of <a href=Joh.htm#v12>ch. 12</a> a miniature of the church is produced (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_1>12:1</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v12_11>11</a>). From <a href=Joh.htm#v12_12>12:12</a> to the end of <a href=Joh.htm#v17>ch. 17</a> an explanation is given concerning how the church is produced through the multiplication and increase of the incarnated God-man by means of His death and resurrection. Chapters <a href=Joh.htm#v18>18</a>&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v20>20</a> show the accomplishing of the multiplication and increase, which causes Him to have many brothers (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_17>20:17</a>) and enables Him to enter into them (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_22>20:22</a>) to be their life and everything that they may be constituted His Body as His increase and expression. Finally, <a href=Joh.htm#v21>ch. 21</a> reveals that He will be with them in an invisible way until His coming back (<a href=Joh.htm#v21_22>21:22</a>)."

BD[">e)\x97"]="<b>The</b><br> &emsp; Verses <a href=Isa.htm#v61_1>1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v61_3>3</a> refer to the ministry of Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah in His two comings. As indicated in <a href=Luk.htm#v4_16>Luke 4:16</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v4_22>22a</a> (see <a href=LukN.htm#n4_18x1>notes</a> there), vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v61_1>1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v61_2>2a</a> in this chapter refer to Christ in His first coming, in which His ministry was to announce the gospel of grace. Verses <a href=Isa.htm#v61_2>2b</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v61_3>3</a> refer to Christ in His second coming, in which His ministry will be to avenge Israel that they may be restored. The prophecy concerning Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah was fulfilled as a foretaste at Christ&rsquo;s first coming, for the age of grace as the acceptable year of Jehovah, the New Testament jubilee (see <a href=LevN.htm#n25_10x1P2>note 10<sup>1</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=Lev.htm#v25>Lev. 25</a>), resulting in the producing and building up of the church. This prophecy will be fulfilled as a full taste at Christ&rsquo;s second coming, for the restoration of Israel unto the new heavens and new earth (<a href=Isa.htm#v65_17>65:17</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v66_22>66:22</a>).<br> &emsp; Christ&rsquo;s coming is of two parts and at two times. In His first coming, Christ came to minister, to dispense, Himself into His followers. In this way He carried out the New Testament ministry to dispense the Triune God into the disciples under His ministry, most of whom were Jews. This ministry in Christ&rsquo;s first coming laid a solid foundation for His second coming. When He comes the second time, He will come mainly in an outward way to rescue Israel from their circumstances and to bring in their restoration (<a href=Zec.htm#v12>Zech. 12</a>&mdash;<a href=Zec.htm#v14>14</a>). This restoration will be expanded to include all things created by God (<a href=Isa.htm#v2_2>2:2</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v2_5>5</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v11_6>11:6</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v11_9>9</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v30_26>30:26</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v35_1>35:1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v35_10>10</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v65_25>65:25</a>). It will last for a millennium, for the thousand-year kingdom (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_2>Rev. 20:2</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_7>7</a>).<br> &emsp; In the eyes of God, Christ&rsquo;s two comings are two aspects of one unique coming of Christ from God to mankind. Hence, in Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy these two comings are like two mountain peaks which, when viewed from a distance, seem to be one peak. For this reason Isaiah viewed Christ&rsquo;s first coming and second coming as being together."

BD["Q*/\x97"]="<b>bore</b><br> &emsp; Luke presents a Man-Savior. After the narration of the conception of the Man-Savior, Luke gives us in this chapter an excellent record of (1) His genuine human birth, which was according to the law of God&rsquo;s creation of man, that He might be a Man-Savior for the salvation of man; (2) His physical circumcision, carried out according to the law of God&rsquo;s ordination (vv. <a href=Luk.htm#v2_21>21</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v2_24>24</a>), that He might be the legal seed of Abraham (<a href=Gen.htm#v17_9>Gen. 17:9</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v17_14>14</a>), the One in whom God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham&mdash;&ldquo;In you all the families of the earth will be blessed&rdquo; (<a href=Gen.htm#v12_3>Gen. 12:3</a>)&mdash;as the gospel announced to him (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_8>Gal. 3:8</a>), could be fulfilled for all the Gentiles (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_14>Gal. 3:14</a>); (3) His physical growth, which was according to the law of human life (<a href=Luk.htm#v2_40>v. 40</a>), that He might be a perfect man to express God for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s redemptive plan; and (4) His proper boyhood, during which He grew in His interest concerning the things of God, which interest was related to His deity as the Son of God the Father (vv. <a href=Luk.htm#v2_40>40</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v2_52>52</a>), that He might have the full measure of wisdom, stature, and favor with God and men.<br> &emsp; The record here concerning the Savior&rsquo;s birth and youth is very different from that in <a href=Mat.htm#v2>Matt. 2</a>. What Matthew recorded of events that occurred at the Savior&rsquo;s birth and during His youth constitutes striking evidence of Christ&rsquo;s legitimate kingship. Luke also recorded the Savior&rsquo;s birth and youth, but what he recorded were events of a different category, events that offer strong proof of Jesus&rsquo; genuine humanity. The two records cover only two of the different aspects of the Savior&rsquo;s wonderful status. See <a href=MatN.htm#n2_2x1>note 2<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v2>Matt. 2</a>."
