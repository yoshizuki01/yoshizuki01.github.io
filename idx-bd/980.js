The number two in the height of the lesser ledge (<a href=Ezk.htm#v43_14>v. 14</a>) signifies not only a testimony but also Christ, the second of the Triune God, who is God&rsquo;s witness (<a href=Rev.htm#v1_5>Rev. 1:5a</a>). The number four in the height of the greater ledge (<a href=Ezk.htm#v43_14>v. 14</a>) and the hearth (<a href=Ezk.htm#v43_15>v. 15</a>) signifies the creatures (<a href=Ezk.htm#v1_5>1:5</a>). The number twelve in the width and length of the hearth (<a href=Ezk.htm#v43_16>v. 16</a>) is composed either of six times two or three times four, the number six signifying man, who was created on the sixth day, and the number three, the Triune God. Thus, the measurements of the four sections of the altar signify that Christ&rsquo;s death was all-inclusive, involving God, man, and all the creatures (<a href=Act.htm#v20_28>Acts 20:28</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v6_6>Rom. 6:6</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v1_15>Col. 1:15</a>)."

BD["*,+\x9a"]="<b>sin</b><br> &emsp; The sin offering signifies Christ as the offering for the sin of God&rsquo;s people. In the Bible sin refers to the indwelling sin in our nature, whereas sins refers to the sinful deeds, the fruit of the indwelling sin. Our sin was dealt with by Christ as our sin offering (<a href=Lev.htm#v4>Lev. 4</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_3>Rom. 8:3</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v5_21>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:21</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v9_26>Heb. 9:26</a>), and our sins, our trespasses, were borne by Christ as our trespass offering (<a href=Lev.htm#v5>Lev. 5</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v53_5>Isa. 53:5a</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v15_3>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:3</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_24>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:24</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v9_28>Heb. 9:28</a>). As the Lamb of God, Christ took away sin in its totality&mdash;the inward sin and the outward sins (<a href=Isa.htm#v53_10>Isa. 53:10</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>John 1:29</a>). See notes <a href=1PeN.htm#n3_18x1>18<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=1Pe.htm#v3>1&nbsp;Pet. 3</a> and <a href=1JoN.htm#n1_7x6>7<sup>6</sup></a> in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1>1&nbsp;John 1</a>.<br> &emsp; Through incarnation the Word, who is God, became flesh, in the likeness of the flesh of sin, i.e., the likeness of a fallen man (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>John 1:1</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>14</a> and <a href=JohN.htm#n1_14x2P1>note 14<sup>2</sup>, par. 1</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_3>Rom. 8:3</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n8_3x3>note 3</a>). Christ was crucified in the flesh and died in the flesh (<a href=1Pe.htm#v3_18>1&nbsp;Pet. 3:18b</a>). Although Christ was a fallen man only in likeness, when He was on the cross, God counted that likeness as real. Since sin, the old man, Satan, the world, and the ruler of the world are all one with the flesh, when Christ died in the flesh, sin was condemned (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_3>Rom. 8:3</a>), the old man was crucified (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_6>Rom. 6:6</a>), Satan was destroyed (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_14>Heb. 2:14</a>), the world was judged, and the ruler of the world was cast out (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_31>John 12:31</a>). Hence, through Christ&rsquo;s death in the flesh all negative things were dealt with. This is the efficacy of the sin offering.<br> &emsp; The sequence of the five offerings in <a href=Lev.htm#v1_1>1:1</a>&mdash;<a href=Lev.htm#v6_7>6:7</a> is a picture of the sequence in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1>1&nbsp;John 1</a>. The burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering bring us into fellowship with God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;John 1:3</a>). Through our fellowship with God, who is light (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_5>1&nbsp;John 1:5</a>), we discover that we are sinful, that we have sin inwardly and sins outwardly. Hence, after our regeneration we still need to take Christ as our sin offering, as indicated in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_8>1&nbsp;John 1:8</a>, and as our trespass offering, as indicated in <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_9>1&nbsp;John 1:9</a>.
