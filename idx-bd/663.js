These two matters are the basic structure of this Epistle. In them grace, mercy, and peace will be with us. The apostle greeted and blessed the believers with grace, mercy, and peace, based on the fact that these two crucial things existed among the believers. When we walk in the truth (<a href=2Jo.htm#v4>v. 4</a>) and love one another (<a href=2Jo.htm#v5>v. 5</a>), we will enjoy the divine grace, mercy, and peace."

Christ is the child born of both the divine and human natures (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_20>Matt. 1:20</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v1_23>23</a>), and He is also the Son in the divine nature given by the Eternal Father. Through the birth of the divine-human child, the Eternal Father gave us His divine Son as a gift. Through such a giving, everyone who believes in, i.e., receives, this dear Son receives eternal life (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_16>John 3:16</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_11>1&nbsp;John 5:11</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_12>12</a>).

Man&rsquo;s will, desire, and wish, with his thought and exposition, were not the source from which any prophecy came; the source was God, by whose Holy Spirit men were borne, as a ship is borne by the wind, to speak out the will, desire, and wish of God."

BD["e+.\x98"]="<b>does</b><br> &emsp; I.e., does not sin habitually. This too is a condition of the life that abides in the Lord. It does not mean that the children of God do not commit sin at all; they may commit sin occasionally. It means that the regenerated believers who have the divine life and live by it do not practice sin. Their character and habit are not to sin but to abide in the Lord. Abiding in the Lord is a believer&rsquo;s living; sinning is a sinner&rsquo;s life."
BD["A)+\x97"]="<b>word</b><br> &emsp; God wanted Ezekiel not only to behold with his eyes but also to hear with his ears (<a href=Ezk.htm#v40_4>40:4</a>); hence, He gave him His words along with His visions. God&rsquo;s word to Ezekiel was not an ordinary word but an express word, a special word. God&rsquo;s express words enable us both to understand the visions and to proclaim and explain what we have seen (<a href=1Co.htm#v2_9>1&nbsp;Cor. 2:9</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v2_13>13</a>)."

BD[":;4\x97"]="<b>Clear</b><br> &emsp; David&rsquo;s prayer in vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v19_12>12</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v19_14>14</a> indicates that David was endeavoring to keep the law to the extent of being dealt with in his secret faults, in his presumptuous sins, in the words of his mouth, and in the meditation of his heart. However, even if David could have been perfect, this would not have pleased God. According to the entire principle of the Bible, God does not want anything merely from man. Regardless of how good a thing is, as long as it is merely human, God will put it aside. What God wants is not a good man, or even a perfect man, but a God-man. God&rsquo;s desire was to be incarnated as a man by the name of Jesus, to die on the cross, to be resurrected, and in resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45b</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_6>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:6</a>, <a href=2Co.htm#v3_17>17a</a>) to indwell us (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_11>Rom. 8:11</a>), to live in us (<a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20</a>), and to live Himself out of us (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>Phil. 1:21a</a>). This psalm should be evaluated in view of the entire principle of the Bible, which is that God&rsquo;s main purpose is to make Himself one with man and to make man one with Him, that He and man may have one life, one nature, and one living. Those who are one with God are God&rsquo;s organism, the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the holy city, New Jerusalem (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>Rev. 21:2</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>22:5</a>)."
