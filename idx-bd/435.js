Thus, the will of God could not be done on earth as in heaven. Hence, God created man with the intention of recovering the earth for Himself (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_26>Gen. 1:26</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v1_28>28</a>). After the fall of man, Christ came to bring the heavenly rule to earth so that the earth could be recovered for God&rsquo;s interest, so that the will of God could be done on earth as in heaven. This is why the new King established the kingdom of the heavens with His followers. The kingdom people must pray for this until the earth is fully recovered for God&rsquo;s will in the coming kingdom age."

BD["P)7\x9a"]="<b>gospel</b><br> &emsp; This is the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God (<a href=Mrk.htm#v1_1>v. 1</a>), the gospel of God, and the gospel of the kingdom of God. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, with all the processes He passed through (such as incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension) and all the redemptive work He accomplished, is the content of the gospel (<a href=Rom.htm#v1_2>Rom. 1:2</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v1_4>4</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v2_10>Luke 2:10</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v2_11>11</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v15_1>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:1</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v15_4>4</a>; <a href=2Ti.htm#v2_8>2&nbsp;Tim. 2:8</a>). Hence, the gospel is of Him. The gospel was planned, promised, and accomplished by God (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_8>Eph. 1:8</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_9>9</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v2_23>Acts 2:23</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v1_2>Rom. 1:2</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v5_21>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:21</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v3_15>Acts 3:15</a>), and it is the power of God unto salvation to all the believers (<a href=Rom.htm#v1_16>Rom. 1:16</a>) that they may be reconciled to God (<a href=2Co.htm#v5_19>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:19</a>) and regenerated by Him (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:3</a>) to be His children (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_12>John 1:12</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_13>13</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_16>Rom. 8:16</a>) and to enjoy all His riches and blessings as their inheritance (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_14>Eph. 1:14</a>). Hence, it is the gospel of God. It brings the believers into the realm of the divine ruling that they may participate in the blessings of the divine life in the divine kingdom (<a href=1Th.htm#v2_12>1&nbsp;Thes. 2:12</a>). Hence, it is also the gospel of the kingdom of God. Thus, its full contents are the same as those of the New Testament with all its bequests. When we believe in this gospel, we inherit the Triune God with His redemption, His salvation, and His divine life with its riches as our eternal portion."

As He was hanging on the cross, His relatives wounded Him (<a href=Zec.htm#v13_6>v. 6</a>), and God called in the sword to strike Him."
BD["M42\x97"]="<b>Spirit</b><br> &emsp; In <a href=Act.htm#v2>Acts 2</a> God poured out His Spirit upon all flesh, and three thousand were saved (<a href=Act.htm#v2_17>Acts 2:17</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v2_41>41</a>). But when God pours out the Spirit of grace upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, many thousands of Israel, even the entire race of Israel alive at that time, will be saved (<a href=Rom.htm#v11_26>Rom. 11:26</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v11_27>27</a>). The Spirit of grace here is in contrast to the Spirit of power in <a href=Act.htm#v1_8>Acts 1:8</a> and <a href=Act.htm#v2_1>2:1</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v2_4>4</a>. The Spirit of power is to strengthen us, but the Spirit of grace is to bring us into the enjoyment of the Triune God. In <a href=Act.htm#v2>Acts 2</a>, at the beginning of the age of grace, the church age, the Spirit was mainly the Spirit of power, but in this verse, at the end, the consummation, of the age of grace, the Spirit will be mainly the Spirit of grace for the enjoyment of the Triune God. The Jews on the day of Pentecost were stubborn and hard; hence, the Spirit of power was poured out to inspire them to repent. But the half of the inhabitants of Jerusalem that survive the attack of Antichrist and his armies (<a href=Zec.htm#v14_2>14:2</a>) will have lost their taste for everything other than God and will have already repented. Therefore, the Spirit of grace will be poured out upon them so that they can receive the Triune God as their enjoyment."
