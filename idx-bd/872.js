BD["i*,\x98"]="<b>love</b><br> &emsp; As the Body of Christ (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>Eph. 1:23</a>), the church is a matter of life; as the new man (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_15>Eph. 2:15</a>), it is a matter of the person of Christ; and as the bride of Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_29>John 3:29</a>), it is a matter of love. The first Epistle to the Ephesians tells us that for the church life we need to be strengthened into our inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts, that we, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_16>Eph. 3:16</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v3_19>19</a>); and it is for the church life that grace is with all those who love the Lord Jesus (<a href=Eph.htm#v6_24>Eph. 6:24</a>). Now this second epistle to the Ephesians reveals that the degradation of the church begins with our leaving the first love toward the Lord. Nothing but love can keep us in a proper relationship with the Lord. The church in Ephesus had good works, labored for the Lord, endured suffering, and tried the false apostles (vv. <a href=Rev.htm#v2_2>2</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v2_3>3</a>), but she left her first love toward the Lord. The leaving of the first love is the source of all the degradation in the succeeding stages of the church."

This is the beast revealed in <a href=Rev.htm#v13_1>Rev. 13:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v13_2>2</a>. The fourth beast was dreadful and frightful and exceedingly strong, as signified by iron.

BD["?72\x97"]="<b>Woe</b><br> &emsp; God was intending to judge the people of Israel, and He sent Jeremiah to tell them that He would use the Babylonians to punish them (vv. <a href=Jer.htm#v15_12>12</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v15_13>13</a>). They responded by persecuting Jeremiah (<a href=Jer.htm#v15_15>v. 15</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v11_19>11:19</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v18_18>18:18</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v18_23>23</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v20_1>20:1</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v20_2>2</a>, <a href=Jer.htm#v20_7>7</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v20_10>10</a>), and this caused him to be disappointed. As Jeremiah complained, God came in to speak to him for his encouragement and strengthening (<a href=Jer.htm#v15_11>v. 11</a>). This indicates that God was always with Jeremiah. In His speaking to Jeremiah, God spoke not as the Divine Being, as the Mighty One, but almost as if He were a man, talking in a very human and personal way. According to the record of this book, as God dealt with His people, He often spoke to them in such a way (e.g., <a href=Jer.htm#v2_1>2:1</a>&mdash;<a href=Jer.htm#v3_5>3:5</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v3_12>3:12</a>&mdash;<a href=Jer.htm#v4_2>4:2</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v16_10>16:10</a>-<a href=Jer.htm#v16_18>18</a>)."

Standing on this word, he must have prayed many times for the fulfillment of this prophecy and for the return of the captives. He would not let anything stop or frustrate his prayer. He knew that his prayer was for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy concerning His elect. Therefore, his prayer was a serious matter."
