Jacob&rsquo;s prophecy concerning Zebulun is a picture of the preaching of the gospel. Zebulun was part of Galilee, the place where the Lord Jesus began His ministry of the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom (<a href=Mat.htm#v4_12>Matt. 4:12</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v4_23>23</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v28_7>28:7</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v28_10>10</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v28_16>16</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v28_20>20</a>). It was a shore for ships, a seaport. In ancient times the ships sailed from the seaport with their cargoes by the power of the wind. This portrays the sending out of the glad tidings of the gospel by the Galilean preachers under the power of the Holy Spirit as the heavenly wind (<a href=Act.htm#v1_8>Acts 1:8</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v2_2>2:2</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v2_41>41</a>).

However, most of those who had returned to Jerusalem from the captivity in Babylon had been born and raised not in Israel but in Babylon. The Babylonian element had been wrought into them and constituted into their being. Therefore, after they returned to the land of their fathers to be citizens of the nation of Israel, they needed to be reconstituted. In order to be reconstituted, they needed to come back to God by coming back to His law, that is, His word. Under Ezra and Nehemiah the returned people of Israel were collectively constituted by and with God through His word to be a nation as God&rsquo;s testimony. See <a href=NehN.htm#n13_30x1P1>note 30<sup>1</sup>, par. 1</a>, in <a href=Neh.htm#v13>ch. 13</a>.<br> &emsp; In order to reconstitute the people of God, there is the need to educate them with the word that comes out of the mouth of God and which expresses God. To reconstitute the people of God is to educate them by putting them into the Word of God that they may be saturated with the word. The word of God is one with the Spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_63>John 6:63</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v6_17>Eph. 6:17</a>). Through our daily reading of the divine Word, the word of God works within us, and the Spirit, through the word, spontaneously dispenses God&rsquo;s nature with God&rsquo;s element into our being, causing us to be constituted with God."
