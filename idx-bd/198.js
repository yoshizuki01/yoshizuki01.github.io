BD["9R9\x97"]="<b>NA</b><br> &emsp; The forty-two chapters in Job leave us with a crucial question of two parts: what was the purpose of God in His creation of man, and what is the purpose of God in His dealing with His chosen people? The entire Bible is needed to answer this question. In particular, the New Testament is a long answer to the question in Job. This answer is the eternal economy of God according to His good pleasure, which is to dispense Himself in His Divine Trinity&mdash;in the Father, in the Son, and in the Spirit&mdash;through His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, with the outpouring of the Spirit, into His chosen and redeemed people, to make all of them the same as He is in life and in nature but not in the Godhead, to make them His duplication that they may express Him (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_28>Rom. 8:28</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>29</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n8_28x1>notes</a>). The issue of such a divine dispensing is the church as the Body of Christ, as the new man, and as the organism of the Triune God. This organism will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the enlarged, the increased, incarnation of God consummated in full, that is, the fullness of the Triune God (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_19>Eph. 3:19</a>) for Him to express Himself corporately in His divinity mingled with humanity for eternity. This is the divine revelation in the New Testament as the answer to the sufferings of Job and to the great question concerning God&rsquo;s purpose in His creation of man and in His dealing with His chosen people."
