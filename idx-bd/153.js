BD["S;J\x8c"]="But when they realized that he was a Jew, one voice arose from all for about two hours, crying out, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
BD["[,+\x98"]="<b>fornication</b><br> &emsp; At Paul&rsquo;s time, in both Corinth and Thessalonica sensuality and immorality were rife in the pagan religions and even were fostered by pagan worship. Man was made to express God (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_26>Gen. 1:26</a>). Concerning this purpose, nothing ruins man more than fornication. This prevents man from being holy, separated unto God, and contaminates man to the uttermost in fulfilling God&rsquo;s holy purpose. Hence, the apostle strongly charged the newly converted Gentile believers to be sanctified unto God, to abstain from fornication, the most gross sin in the eyes of God, that they might avoid its damage and contamination."
BD["[*5\x8c"]="And because of this we also thank God unceasingly that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted <I>it</I> not <I>as</I> the word of men but even as it truly is, the word of God, which also operates in you who believe."
BD["X-G\x8c"]="For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh."
BD["+L.\x97"]="<b>married</b><br> &emsp; God allowed the daughters to marry according to their taste but only within the family of the tribe of their father. This indicates that although the Lord gives us freedom, this freedom must be exercised within the limit, the boundary, of God&rsquo;s regulation (cf. <a href=Gal.htm#v5_13>Gal. 5:13</a>)."
BD["X.\@\x98"]="<b>love</b><br> &emsp; The enjoyment of the Lord as grace is with those who love Him. In this book the phrase in love, which is rich in feeling, is used repeatedly (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_4>1:4</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v3_17>3:17</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v4_2>4:2</a>, <a href=Eph.htm#v4_15>15</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v4_16>16</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v5_2>5:2</a>). Later, the church in Ephesus was rebuked by the Lord because she had lost her first love toward Him (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_4>Rev. 2:4</a>). One of the main points revealed in this book is that the church, which is the Body of Christ, is also the bride of Christ, Christ&rsquo;s wife. With the Body, the emphasis is on taking Christ as life; with the wife, the emphasis is on loving Christ. Therefore, this book emphasizes and also concludes with our love toward the Lord. The church in Ephesus, the recipient of this Epistle, failed in the matter of loving the Lord. Such a failure became the source of and main reason for the failure of the church throughout the ages (<a href=Rev.htm#v2>Rev. 2</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v3>3</a>)."
BD["X-C\x98"]="<b>church</b><br> &emsp; In this section of exhortation the apostle presented another aspect of the church, that of the bride. This aspect reveals that the church comes out of Christ, as Eve came out of Adam (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_21>Gen. 2:21</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_22>22</a>), that it has the same life and nature as Christ, and that it becomes one with Him as His counterpart, as Eve became one flesh with Adam (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_24>Gen. 2:24</a>). The church as the new man is a matter of grace and reality, whereas the church as the bride of Christ is a matter of love and light. The apostle&rsquo;s exhortation in <a href=Eph.htm#v4>ch. 4</a> is focused on the new man, which has grace and reality as its basic elements, whereas his exhortation in this chapter is focused on the bride of Christ, which has love and light as its basic substances. In grace and reality we should walk as the new man, and in love and light we should live as the bride of Christ."
BD["+J4\x97"]="<b>Jordan</b><br> &emsp; The best part of the good land is surrounded by two seas&mdash;the Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea&mdash;and a river&mdash;the Jordan. These two seas and this river all signify the death of Christ. This indicates that the enjoyment of Christ is closely related to His death. The enjoyment of Christ must be in the sphere, the territory, of His death (cf. <a href=Phi.htm#v3_7>Phil. 3:7</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_11>11</a>).<br> &emsp; That the good land rose up from the waters that bordered it on either side indicates that it is an elevated, uplifted land. This signifies the resurrected and ascended Christ, the heavenly Christ, who has entered into us in His resurrection (<a href=Joh.htm#v20_22>John 20:22</a>) and whose riches we enjoy in His ascension (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_6>Eph. 2:6</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v3_1>Col. 3:1</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v3_4>4</a>)."
BD["X,F\x98"]="<b>Spirit</b><br> &emsp; The apostle&rsquo;s exhortation in vv. <a href=Eph.htm#v4_17>17</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v4_32>32</a> not only takes grace and reality as the basic elements but also takes the life of God (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_18>v. 18</a>) and the Spirit of God as the basic factors on the positive side, and the devil (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_27>v. 27</a>) as a factor on the negative side. It is by the life of God in the Spirit of God, and by not giving place to the devil, that we can live a life full of grace and reality, as the Lord Jesus did."
