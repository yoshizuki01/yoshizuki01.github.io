Thus, the Holy Spirit comes not only from the Father but also from the Son, and He is the reality not only of the Father but also of the Son.

His falling into the ground was to produce the many grains; His being lifted up on the tree was to draw all men to Himself. The many grains produced by His falling into the ground are the &ldquo;all men&rdquo; drawn by His being lifted up on the tree.<br> &emsp; In this chapter the Lord&rsquo;s death is revealed not as the redeeming death but as the producing, generating death.

We must experience the Lord&rsquo;s death that we may participate in the threefold purpose that He accomplished."
BD["X,*\x97"]="<b>lowliness</b><br> &emsp; To be lowly is to remain in a low estate, and to be meek is to not fight for oneself. We should exercise these two virtues in dealing with ourselves. To be long-suffering is to endure mistreatment. We should exercise this virtue in dealing with others. By these virtues we bear (not just tolerate) one another; that is, we do not forsake the troublesome ones but bear them in love. This is the expression of life.<br> &emsp; These virtues are not found in our natural humanity but are in the humanity of Jesus. The fact that the virtues are mentioned here, before the oneness of the Spirit in <a href=Eph.htm#v4_3>v. 3</a>, indicates that we must have these virtues in order to keep the oneness of the Spirit. This implies that in the uniting Spirit there is the transformed humanity, the humanity transformed by the resurrection life of Christ."
