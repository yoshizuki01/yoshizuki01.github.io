In the same way, the Father loved the Son&rsquo;s believers by giving them His life, His nature, His fullness, and His glory that they might express Him in the Son. This is a story of love as well as glory."
BD["U50\x97"]="<b>never</b><br> &emsp; I.e., survives everything, holds its place. Love survives everything and holds its place forever. It never fails, never fades out or comes to an end. It is like the eternal life of God. All the gifts, whether prophecies, or tongues, or knowledge, are means for God&rsquo;s operation; they are not life, which expresses God. Hence, they will cease and be rendered useless. They are all dispensational. Only life, which love expresses, is eternal. According to the succeeding verses, all gifts are for the immature child in this age. They will all be rendered useless in the next age. Only love is characteristic of a mature man and will last for eternity. Hence, when we live and act by love, we have a foretaste of the next age and of eternity."

With the promise there is only God, who is directly related to the one who receives the promise, without a go-between. The responsibility with respect to the law depends not on one party but on two, whereas the responsibility with regard to the promise depends only on the giver, God. Hence, the law is inferior to the promise. The Galatians gave up the superior and went back to the inferior."

The woman realizes by her female constitution that to have long hair to cover her head is a glory. This too is strong ground for the apostle&rsquo;s teaching concerning head covering. His teaching is not according to customs or practices established by man but according to man&rsquo;s nature, which was created by God."

This indicates that the background of <a href=Psa.htm#v68>Psa. 68</a> is God&rsquo;s move in the tabernacle with the Ark as its center. Wherever the Ark, a type of Christ, went, the victory was won.

It was easy for their child to grow and become strong in his spirit and thereby to live in the wilderness.

Some say that speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of the baptism in the Spirit, and that later it becomes a gift of the Spirit. They say that every believer must speak in tongues as the initial evidence, but that not every believer needs to have the gift of speaking in tongues. This kind of teaching has no ground in the New Testament. The New Testament makes it abundantly clear that speaking in tongues is only one of the many gifts of the Spirit and that not all the believers have this gift."
