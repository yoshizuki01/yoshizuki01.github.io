BD[":U1\x99"]="<b>queen</b><br> &emsp; Signifying the church, especially the overcomers, as the unique wife of Christ. In <a href=Rev.htm#v19_7>Rev. 19:7</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v19_9>9a</a>, the wife of the Lamb is a corporate bride composed of the overcoming believers invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb (see notes <a href=RevN.htm#n19_7x2>7<sup>2</sup></a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n19_9x1>9<sup>1</sup></a> there). Likewise, in this psalm the queen does not signify an individual; rather, she signifies a corporate entity composed of all her companions: the daughters of kings as the honorable women and the virgins as her friends (<a href=Psa.htm#v45_14>v. 14</a>). Thus, in this psalm Solomon the king with his many wives and concubines, who were princesses, daughters of Gentile kings (<a href=1Ki.htm#v11_1>1&nbsp;Kings 11:1</a>, <a href=1Ki.htm#v11_3>3</a>), are used in a positive sense to typify Christ as the King with His corporate wife, the church (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_29>John 3:29</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v5_24>Eph. 5:24</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v5_25>25</a>, <a href=Eph.htm#v5_31>31</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v5_32>32</a>), composed of His believers from every tribe, tongue, people, and nation (<a href=Rev.htm#v5_9>Rev. 5:9</a>).<br> &emsp; In <a href=Psa.htm#v45_8>v. 8</a> the church is typified by the ivory palaces, the building, and in this verse the church is pictured as the queen, the wife. In the entire Scriptures these two figures&mdash;the building and the bride&mdash;are used to signify the church (cf. <a href=Gen.htm#v2_22>Gen. 2:22</a> and <a href=GenN.htm#n2_22x1>notes</a>). On the one hand, the church is the building, the house, of God (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>), and on the other hand it is the bride, the wife, of Christ (<a href=2Co.htm#v11_2>2&nbsp;Cor. 11:2</a>)."

BD["i:)\x97"]="<b>another</b><br> &emsp; This Angel with great authority is Christ. As He comes down out of heaven, the earth is illumined with His glory. In <a href=Rev.htm#v10_1>10:1</a> Christ is still clothed with a cloud, and in <a href=Rev.htm#v14_14>14:14</a> He is sitting on the cloud; whereas here His glory shines over the earth, indicating that His coming back to earth is nearer at hand than the coming mentioned in <a href=Rev.htm#v10_1>10:1</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v14_14>14:14</a>. He will come out of heaven, first in the cloud secretly, then on the cloud openly; eventually, He will shine over the earth to destroy Babylon the Great, the city of Rome, with His great authority."
