BD["3;*\x97"]="<b>Isaiah</b><br> &emsp; The link between the Old Testament books of history and the New Testament is God&rsquo;s economy, which is for Christ and His Body, the church. This link is shown in the kings&rsquo; history, which includes the prophets, who, as God&rsquo;s overcomers, prophesied concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Again and again the prophets came in either to help the kings or to deal with them, as illustrated here by Isaiah&rsquo;s helping Hezekiah (cf. <a href=2Sa.htm#v7_1>2&nbsp;Sam. 7:1</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v7_17>17</a>; <a href=2Sa.htm#v12_1>12:1</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v12_15>15a</a>; <a href=1Ki.htm#v18>1&nbsp;Kings 18</a>; <a href=2Ki.htm#v3>2&nbsp;Kings 3</a>). The prophecies in <a href=Isa.htm#v7_14>Isaiah 7:14</a> and <a href=Isa.htm#v9_6>9:6</a> indicate that God would put humanity upon Himself, mingling His divinity with humanity, and the prophecy in <a href=Isa.htm#v53>Isaiah 53</a> unveils that in His humanity the God who had become man would be man&rsquo;s Redeemer who would be slain for man&rsquo;s sin. Thus, in typology the history of the kings is linked through the prophecies of the prophets to God&rsquo;s becoming a man to redeem man back to Himself that He might make His redeemed people the same as God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead so that God can consummate His economy in the Body of Christ as the enlargement of Christ. This Body of Christ will consummate in the New Jerusalem as God&rsquo;s universal, corporate expression and enlargement for eternity."

In addition to being perfect inwardly and upright outwardly, Job feared God positively and turned away from evil negatively. However, God did not create man merely to fear Him and not do anything wrong. Rather, God created man in His own image and according to His likeness that man may express God (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_26>Gen. 1:26</a> and <a href=GenN.htm#n1_26x1>notes</a>). To express God is higher than fearing God and turning away from evil.<br> &emsp; Job was also a man of integrity (<a href=Job.htm#v2_3>2:3</a>, <a href=Job.htm#v2_9>9</a>; <a href=Job.htm#v27_5>27:5</a>; <a href=Job.htm#v31_6>31:6</a>).
