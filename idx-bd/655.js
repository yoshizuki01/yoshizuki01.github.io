BD["ALB\x97"]="<b>new</b><br> &emsp; In His recovery by life the Lord gives us a new heart and a new spirit. Our heart is our loving organ, and our spirit is our receiving organ. While we are in a fallen or backslidden state, our heart toward the Lord is stony and hard, and our spirit is deadened (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_1>Eph. 2:1</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v4_18>4:18</a>). When the Lord saves us or revives us, He renews our heart, making our stony heart a heart of flesh, a heart that is soft and loving toward Him (cf. <a href=2Co.htm#v3_3>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:3</a>). Furthermore, He enlivens and renews our spirit with His divine life (<a href=Col.htm#v2_13>Col. 2:13</a>). As a result, we love the Lord and desire Him with our renewed heart, and we can contact Him, receive Him, and contain Him by exercising our renewed spirit."
