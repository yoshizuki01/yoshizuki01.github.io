BD["O/3\x98"]="<b>good</b><br> &emsp; In the parallel verse, <a href=Luk.htm#v11_13>Luke 11:13</a>, it is the Holy Spirit instead of good things, because Luke emphasizes the blessing of the gospel, the center of which is the Spirit (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_8>Gal. 3:8</a>, <a href=Gal.htm#v3_14>14</a>). Since Matthew stresses the kingdom of the heavens, good things should refer to the blessings of the reality of the kingdom, as revealed in chs. <a href=Mat.htm#v5>5</a>&mdash;<a href=Mat.htm#v7>7</a>, blessings to be given as gifts to the kingdom people."

BD[")5*\x97"]="<b>Sanctify</b><br> &emsp; The purpose of the exodus of God&rsquo;s people from the world is to be sanctified to the Lord. Sanctification is based on redemption. The Lord required only the firstborn (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v13_2>2</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v13_12>12</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v13_13>13</a>) to be sanctified because they were the redeemed ones (<a href=Exo.htm#v12_12>12:12</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v12_13>13</a>). According to the divine requirement, all who are redeemed must also be sanctified. Redemption is for the security of God&rsquo;s people; sanctification is for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose. See <a href=Rom.htm#v6_19>Rom. 6:19</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v6_22>22</a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n6_19x2>note 19<sup>2</sup></a>."
BD["O-9\x98"]="<b>fulfill</b><br> &emsp; Here for Christ to fulfill the law means (1) that, on the positive side, He kept the law, (2) that, on the negative side, through His substitutionary death on the cross He fulfilled the requirement of the law, and (3) that in this section He complemented the old law with His new law, as repeatedly expressed by the word &ldquo;But I say to (or, tell) you&rdquo; (vv. <a href=Mat.htm#v5_22>22</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v5_28>28</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v5_32>32</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v5_34>34</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v5_39>39</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v5_44>44</a>). Christ&rsquo;s keeping of the law qualified Him to fulfill the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross. Christ&rsquo;s fulfilling of the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross brought in the resurrection life to complement the law, to fill the law to the full. The old law, the lower law, with the demand that it be kept and the requirement that man be punished, is over. The kingdom people, as the children of the Father, now need to fulfill only the new law, the higher law, by the resurrection life, which is the eternal life of the Father. The old law was given through Moses, whereas the new law was decreed by Christ personally.<br> &emsp; Concerning the law there are two aspects: the commandments of the law and the principle of the law. The commandments of the law were fulfilled and complemented by the Lord&rsquo;s coming, whereas the principle of the law was replaced by the principle of faith according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy."
