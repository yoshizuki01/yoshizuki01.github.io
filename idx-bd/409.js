BD["P)7\x98"]="<b>Repent</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means have a change of mind. To repent is to have a change of mind with regret for the past and a turn for the future. On the negative side, to repent before God is not only to repent of sins and wrongdoings but also to repent of the world and its corruption, which usurp and corrupt people whom God created for Himself, and to repent of our God-forsaking life in the past. On the positive side, it is to turn to God in every way and in everything for the fulfillment of His purpose in creating man. It is a &ldquo;repentance unto God,&rdquo; and is to &ldquo;repent and turn to God&rdquo; (<a href=Act.htm#v20_21>Acts 20:21</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v26_20>26:20</a>).

Since the reality of the offerings is Christ, the laws of the offerings correspond to the law of the life of Christ, which is the law of the Spirit of life (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_2>Rom. 8:2</a>). These laws indicate that even in the enjoyment of Christ we should not be lawless but should be regulated by the law of life (cf. <a href=1Co.htm#v9_26>1&nbsp;Cor. 9:26</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v9_27>27</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v11_17>11:17</a>, <a href=1Co.htm#v11_27>27</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v11_29>29</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v6_15>Gal. 6:15</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v6_16>16</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v3_13>Phil. 3:13</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_16>16</a>)."

It does not mean that these righteous ones were not sinful, without sin and sins. They were blameless, but not without blemish. They still needed the unblemished sin and trespass offerings in type (<a href=Lev.htm#v4_28>Lev. 4:28</a>; <a href=Lev.htm#v5_15>5:15</a>) for their expiation that they might have contact with God."

The ten plagues can be grouped into four categories. The first group includes the plagues of blood, frogs, and lice (<a href=Exo.htm#v7_15>7:15</a>&mdash;<a href=Exo.htm#v8_19>8:19</a>); the second group, the plagues of flies, pestilence, and boils (<a href=Exo.htm#v8_20>8:20</a>&mdash;<a href=Exo.htm#v9_12>9:12</a>); the third group, the plagues of hail, locusts, and darkness (<a href=Exo.htm#v9_13>9:13</a>&mdash;<a href=Exo.htm#v10_29>10:29</a>); and the fourth group, the plague of the killing of the firstborn (<a href=Exo.htm#v11_1>11:1</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v11_10>10</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v12_29>12:29</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v12_30>30</a>). The plagues in the first group were troublesome but not injurious; the plagues in the second group caused harm both to beasts and to men; the plagues in the third group destroyed the environment; and the last plague terminated the worldly life. By means of the ten plagues God was able to accomplish the exodus of His chosen people from Egypt and fully expose the nature and result of the life in the world (cf. <a href=Rev.htm#v16_1>Rev. 16:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v16_21>21</a>)."
