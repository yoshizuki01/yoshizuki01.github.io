BD["*+)\x97"]="<b>peace</b><br> &emsp; The peace offering signifies Christ as our peace with God that we may enjoy Him with God and with man in fellowship and joy (<a href=Num.htm#v10_10>Num. 10:10</a>; <a href=Deu.htm#v27_7>Deut. 27:7</a>). It is fulfilled primarily in our enjoying Christ at the Lord&rsquo;s table in the breaking of bread for the remembrance of Him and in the offering of Christ to the Father for the worship of the Father (<a href=Mat.htm#v26_26>Matt. 26:26</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v26_30>30</a>). The peace offering, which implies fellowship with the Triune God and includes the enjoyment of the Triune God, is illustrated in <a href=Luk.htm#v15_23>Luke 15:23</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v15_24>24</a> by the fattened calf as the peaceful enjoyment between the receiving father (God) and the returned prodigal (a sinner).<br> &emsp; The peace offering is the Old Testament type of the Lord&rsquo;s table. At the Lord&rsquo;s table the believers enjoy Christ as their peace offering for their fellowship with God and with one another. This enjoyment of the peace offering issues from the burnt offering, the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering (<a href=Lev.htm#v3_5>v. 5</a> and <a href=LevN.htm#n3_5x1>note</a>). Our enjoyment of Christ as these four offerings has an issue, a result&mdash;the enjoyment of Christ as our peace offering for us to have fellowship with God and with our fellow believers.
