God has called us into such a fellowship that we may enjoy Christ as our God-given portion. This word, like the word in <a href=1Co.htm#v1_2>v. 2</a> concerning Christ&rsquo;s being theirs and ours, stresses again the crucial fact that Christ is the unique center of the believers for the solving of the problems among them, especially the problem of division.<br> &emsp; This book unveils to us that the very Christ, into whom we all have been called, is all-inclusive. He is the portion given to us by God (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_2>v. 2</a>). He is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us (vv. <a href=1Co.htm#v1_24>24</a>, <a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>30</a>). He is the Lord of glory (<a href=1Co.htm#v2_8>2:8</a>) for our glorification (<a href=1Co.htm#v2_7>2:7</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v8_30>Rom. 8:30</a>). He is the depths (deep things) of God (<a href=1Co.htm#v2_10>2:10</a>). He is the unique foundation of God&rsquo;s building (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_11>3:11</a>). He is our Passover (<a href=1Co.htm#v5_7>5:7</a>), the unleavened bread (<a href=1Co.htm#v5_8>5:8</a>), the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and the spiritual rock (<a href=1Co.htm#v10_3>10:3</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v10_4>4</a>). He is the Head (<a href=1Co.htm#v11_3>11:3</a>) and the Body (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_12>12:12</a>). He is the firstfruits (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_20>15:20</a>, <a href=1Co.htm#v15_23>23</a>), the second man (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_47>15:47</a>), and the last Adam (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>15:45</a>); and as such He became the life-giving Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>15:45</a>) that we may receive Him into us as our everything. This all-inclusive One, with the riches of at least twenty items, God has given to us as our portion for our enjoyment. We should concentrate on Him, not on any persons, things, or matters other than Him. We should focus on Him as our unique center appointed by God, that all the problems among the believers may be solved. It is into the fellowship of such a One that we have been called by God. This fellowship of God&rsquo;s Son became the fellowship that the apostles shared with the believers (<a href=Act.htm#v2_42>Acts 2:42</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;John 1:3</a>) in His Body, the church, and should be the fellowship that we enjoy in partaking of His blood and His body at His table (<a href=1Co.htm#v10_16>10:16</a>, <a href=1Co.htm#v10_21>21</a>). Such a fellowship, which is carried out by the Spirit (<a href=2Co.htm#v13_14>2&nbsp;Cor. 13:14</a>), must be unique because He is unique; it forbids any division among the members of His unique Body."

To be kept in the fold is transitional and temporary. To be in the pasture enjoying its riches is final and permanent. Before Christ came, the law was a ward, and being under the law was transitional. Now that Christ has come, all God&rsquo;s chosen people must come out of the law and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_23>Gal. 3:23</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v3_25>25</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v4_3>4:3</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v4_5>5</a>).
