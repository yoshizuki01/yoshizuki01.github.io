Eternal denotes not only duration of time, which is everlasting, without end, but also quality, which is absolutely perfect and complete, without any shortage or defect. Such an expression emphasizes the eternal nature of the divine life, the life of the eternal God. The apostles saw this eternal life and testified and reported it to people. Their experience was not of any doctrine but of Christ, the Son of God, as the eternal life, and their testimony and preaching were not of theology or biblical knowledge but of such a solid life."

BD["e))\x9c"]="<b>life</b><br> &emsp; The writings of John are books of mysteries. In this Epistle, life, that is, the divine life, the eternal life, the life of God, which is imparted into the believers in Christ and is abiding in them, is the first mystery (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_2>v. 2</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_25>2:25</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_15>3:15</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_11>5:11</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_13>13</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_20>20</a>). Issuing out of this mystery is another mystery, the mystery of the fellowship of the divine life (vv. <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_3>3</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_7>7</a>). After that is the mystery of the anointing of the Triune God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_20>2:20</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_27>27</a>). Then there is the mystery of abiding in the Lord (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_27>2:27</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_28>28</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_6>3:6</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_24>24</a>). The fifth mystery is the mystery of the divine birth (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_29>2:29</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_9>3:9</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v4_7>4:7</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_1>5:1</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_4>4</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_18>18</a>). The sixth is the divine seed (<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_9>3:9</a>). And the last is the water, the blood, and the Spirit (<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_6>5:6</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_12>12</a>)."
BD["a16\x99"]="<b>conscience</b><br> &emsp; The blood of Christ purifies our conscience to serve the living God. To serve the living God requires a blood-purified conscience. To worship in dead religion or to serve any dead thing, anything that is outside God, does not require our conscience to be purified. The conscience is the leading part of our spirit. The living God whom we desire to serve always comes to our spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_24>John 4:24</a>) by touching our conscience. He is righteous, holy, and living. Our defiled conscience needs to be purified that we may serve Him in a living way. To worship God in our mind in a religious way does not require this."
