His death stroke was healed means that the Caesar will be resuscitated from death. (See <a href=RevN.htm#n17_11x1>note 11<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v17>ch. 17</a>.) Because of this the whole earth will marvel and follow after him."
BD["i4.\x97"]="<b>wilderness</b><br> &emsp; After the rapture of the man-child, the woman is left on earth to suffer persecution (<a href=Rev.htm#v12_13>v. 13</a>). During the time of the great tribulation, God will prepare a place where she can be nourished for a thousand two hundred and sixty days before He brings His people into the millennial kingdom. (This is similar to the time when Pharaoh persecuted the children of Israel and God brought His people to the wilderness, where He nourished them before bringing them into the good land.) That the woman (the remaining and living majority of the believers) will be preserved and nourished by God for a thousand two hundred and sixty days during the great tribulation is a strong proof that their rapture will take place on the last day of the three and a half years of the great tribulation, that is, the last day of the one thousand two hundred and sixty days."
