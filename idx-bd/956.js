The groups of people sat down in well-ordered square plots, so that they looked like flowering plants arranged in plots in a garden. This figure implies that those who are fed by the Lord are like fragrant, beautiful flower beds (S.S <a href=Mrk.htm#v5_13>5:13</a>; <a href=Mrk.htm#v6_2>6:2</a>)."

On one hand, the law continues to exist, for God has not recalled, annulled, or abolished it. On the other hand, because of the crucifixion of our old man (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_6>6:6</a>), who is the first husband mentioned in these verses, we are no longer under the law and no longer have anything to do with it. Instead, we have become the wife of Christ; that is, we have become those who depend on Christ."

Once a person is married, he is fully bound, having no way to be released except through the committing of fornication by the spouse (or through the death of the spouse). It was such a realization that caused the disciples to think that it was not profitable to marry. But it was not under their control."

Psalms <a href=Psa.htm#v85>85</a>, <a href=Psa.htm#v86>86</a>, and <a href=Psa.htm#v88>88</a> concern three matters: the restoration of God&rsquo;s people, personal salvation, and release from sufferings, respectively. These three matters have been the continual concern of God&rsquo;s people for centuries. According to the human concept, these matters are positive, but God does not regard these things as we do. Psalms <a href=Psa.htm#v87>87</a> and <a href=Psa.htm#v89>89</a> reveal that God&rsquo;s concern, according to His heart, is Christ with Zion, in which are many saints and which is for the house of God and the city of God that Christ may possess the entire earth."

The second section, chs. <a href=Joh.htm#v14>14</a>&mdash;<a href=Joh.htm#v21>21</a>, describes how the Lord as the Son of Man went through His death and resurrection to bring man into God that man and God, God and man, might be built together as a mutual abode. This chapter, coming at the end of the first section, is a dividing line and a turning point."
BD["O8;\x97"]="<b>keys</b><br> &emsp; According to history there were two keys.

The one blood ordained by God is the blood of Jesus Christ shed on the cross (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_53>John 6:53</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v6_55>55</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v10_16>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:16a</a>, <a href=1Co.htm#v10_21>21a</a>), and the one belief is the belief in the Christ who died on the cross for us (see <a href=RomN.htm#n1_5x3>note 5<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Rom.htm#v1>Rom. 1</a>)."

BD["O4G\x97"]="<b>blasphemy</b><br> &emsp; Blaspheming the Spirit differs from insulting the Spirit (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_29>Heb. 10:29</a>). To insult the Spirit is to disobey Him willfully. Many believers do this. If they confess this sin, they will be forgiven and cleansed by the Lord&rsquo;s blood (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_7>1&nbsp;John 1:7</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_9>9</a>). But to blaspheme the Spirit is to slander Him, as the Pharisees did in <a href=Mat.htm#v12_24>v. 24</a>. It was by the Spirit that the Lord cast out a demon. But the Pharisees, seeing it, said that the Lord cast out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons. This was blasphemy against the Spirit. By such blasphemy the Pharisees&rsquo; rejection of the heavenly King reached its climax."

The Father can never be separated from the Son, and the Son can never be separated from the Father. When the Son was on the earth, He was still in heaven with the Father (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_13>3:13</a>). This proves that when God became flesh (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>1:14</a>), it was the Son with the Father, the Father with the Son, in the Spirit (that is, the entire God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit) who became flesh (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_16>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:16</a>).

BD["U*/\x97"]="<b>God</b><br> &emsp; God&rsquo;s wisdom is Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_24>1:24</a>), who is the hidden mystery (<a href=Col.htm#v1_26>Col. 1:26</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v1_27>27</a>), predestined, predesignated, and foreordained before the ages for our glory."

Hence, in this verse to live means to be alive in spirit. It does not signify resurrection of the physical body, which is mentioned in vv. <a href=Joh.htm#v5_28>28</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v5_29>29</a>."
BD["U)2\x97"]="<b>name</b><br> &emsp; With this verse the apostle began to deal with the divisions among the Corinthians. First, he besought them through the name of our Lord, which is the name above all names (<a href=Phi.htm#v2_9>Phil. 2:9</a>) and should be the unique name among all His believers. However, the divisive Corinthians ranked the names of Paul, Apollos, and Cephas with the name of Christ, just as Peter on the mount of transfiguration ranked Moses and Elijah with Christ (<a href=Mat.htm#v17_1>Matt. 17:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v17_8>8</a>). To keep the oneness in the Lord and to avoid divisions, we need to uplift and exalt the unique name of our Lord by dropping all names other than this highest name."
BD["S2)\x97"]="<b>Italian</b><br> &emsp; Here the Lord took a further step in His evangelistic work. By this He reached another utter Gentile, a man of Italy of the Roman Empire in Europe. Thus the door of the gospel was opened to all the Gentiles. It was difficult for the Jewish apostles and disciples, with their Jewish background and habit, to come near the Gentiles (<a href=Act.htm#v10_28>v. 28</a>). Hence, this was an extraordinary move, needing the participation of an angel of God (<a href=Act.htm#v10_3>v. 3</a>), just as when Philip approached the Ethiopian, a man from Africa, in <a href=Act.htm#v8_26>8:26</a>. In the two cases the Spirit spoke to Philip and to Peter, respectively, in a particular way (<a href=Act.htm#v8_29>8:29</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v10_19>10:19</a>)."

BD["S1,\x97"]="<b>Me</b><br> &emsp; A corporate &ldquo;Me,&rdquo; comprising Jesus the Lord and all His believers. Saul did not have this revelation. He thought that he was persecuting Stephen and other Jesus-followers, who were in the Way, which he considered heresy (<a href=Act.htm#v24_14>24:14</a>). He did not know that when he persecuted these he persecuted Jesus, for they were one with Him by being united to Him through their faith in Him. He considered that he was persecuting people on earth, never thinking that he touched anyone in heaven. To his great surprise a voice from heaven told him that He was the One whom he was persecuting and that His name was Jesus. To him this was a unique revelation in the universe! By this he began to see that the Lord Jesus and His believers are one great person&mdash;the wonderful &ldquo;Me.&rdquo; This must have impressed and affected him for his future ministry concerning Christ and the church as the great mystery of God (<a href=Eph.htm#v5_32>Eph. 5:32</a>) and laid a solid foundation for his unique ministry."

He is such an immeasurable and unlimited One, who comes from above, who is above all, to whom the Father has given all, and who dispenses the Spirit without measure. Such a One needs a universal increase to be His bride to match Him, as revealed in vv. <a href=Joh.htm#v3_22>22</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_30>30</a>. He who believes into this immeasurable One has eternal life; he who disobeys this One is under the wrath of God."
BD["P3A\x97"]="<b>forgive</b><br> &emsp; Forgiving another&rsquo;s offense is the ground for our heavenly Father to forgive us. This is true especially in our prayer time. In a strict sense, we cannot pray with a heart that holds anything against anyone, i.e., that feels offended by anyone or is unable to forget another&rsquo;s offense."

Yet the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy here still has not been fulfilled, even up to the twentieth century. The Lord is not building His church in Christendom, which is composed of the apostate Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant denominations. This prophecy is being fulfilled through the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, in which the building of the genuine church is being accomplished."
