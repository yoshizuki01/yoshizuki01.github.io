Both the passover and the Lord&rsquo;s table remind us that we were destined to die under God&rsquo;s righteous judgment, but God prepared Christ to be our replacement to die for us, thus saving us from the death-judgment of God&rsquo;s righteousness. Furthermore, they remind us that we do not belong to ourselves but to the One who replaced us and who is now our life and life supply.

BD[")0?\x97"]="<b>redemption</b><br> &emsp; The redemption in this verse looks forward to the redemption accomplished by Christ. According to His righteousness God should have judged the heavens and the earth immediately after the fall of Adam. However, in order to fulfill His purpose to have a dwelling place among men, God put the universe under the redemption of Christ, which in His eternal view was foreordained before the foundation of the world (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_19>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:19</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_20>20</a> and <a href=1PeN.htm#n1_20x1>note 20<sup>1</sup></a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v2_9>Heb. 2:9</a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n2_9x3>note 3</a>). Hence, God has the freedom to either preserve the universe or to judge it and destroy it. Today, God extends His mercy by viewing all the people of the world under the redemption of Christ so that they might have the opportunity to repent and receive His redemption (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v3_18>John 3:18</a>). Pharaoh and the Egyptians rejected the redemption ordained by God and thus exposed themselves to God&rsquo;s judgment (cf. <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_2>1&nbsp;John 2:2</a> and <a href=1JoN.htm#n2_2x2>note 2</a>).
