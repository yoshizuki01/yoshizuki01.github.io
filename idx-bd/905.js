His status as an apostle of Christ qualified him to release God&rsquo;s revelation, whereas his status as a prisoner of the Lord spoke forth his walk in the Lord, by which he could inspire and beseech the saints to walk in the Lord as he did.

Its purpose was to connect the legs and strengthen them, the handbreadth signifying its being full of strength to connect and strengthen. The rim of gold on the frame is for keeping and holding (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n25_11x2>note 11<sup>2</sup></a>). In spiritual experience, the enjoyment of Christ as a feast strengthens us, connects us, upholds us, and keeps us."

That the promised land, an elevated land full of life and the abundance of fruit (<a href=Deu.htm#v8_7>Deut. 8:7</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v8_8>8</a>), was surrounded by water and wilderness indicates that outside of Christ, the reality of the good land (see <a href=DeuN.htm#n8_7x1>note 7<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Deu.htm#v8>Deut. 8</a>), there is nothing but death and barrenness."

Hence, their request (<a href=Num.htm#v27_4>v. 4</a>) is for us all. In order to keep their father&rsquo;s name and his inheritance within their tribe, the daughters of Zelophehad took the way of fellowship by contacting their stronger kinsmen (<a href=Num.htm#v27_4>v. 4</a>). The same principle applies to the keeping of the enjoyment of Christ by the weaker believers in the church life."

This became God&rsquo;s food, a portion of which was also the food of the priests. Thus, the Levites lived on the tithe from the people, and God and the priests lived on the tithe from the Levites.<br> &emsp; God and His people, including the serving ones, were one large family. In this family God the Father as the source gave the good land to His children, who then had to work the land. Eventually, they reaped a harvest, which was to be enjoyed by both God and all the people. They were to bring a portion of the produce to the serving ones, and the serving ones were to offer a portion of what they received to God. In this way, God and His serving ones shared the tithes and lived together. The good land is a type of the all-inclusive Christ (see <a href=DeuN.htm#n8_7x1>note 7<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Deu.htm#v8>Deut. 8</a>).

Then Christ will be the produce not only for our satisfaction but also for God&rsquo;s satisfaction."
