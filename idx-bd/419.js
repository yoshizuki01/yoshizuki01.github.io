BD["i60\x97"]="<b>Babylon</b><br> &emsp; The modifying clause who has made all the nations drink&hellip; indicates that Babylon here is the religious, mysterious Babylon, which is the Roman Catholic Church, as in <a href=Rev.htm#v17_2>17:2</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v17_6>6</a>, not the material Babylon, as in <a href=Rev.htm#v18_2>18:2</a>. Antichrist will destroy all religions when he breaks the covenant with Israel in the middle of the last week (seven years&mdash;<a href=Dan.htm#v9_27>Dan. 9:27</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v11_31>11:31</a>). This will be the beginning of the great tribulation (<a href=Mat.htm#v24_21>Matt. 24:21</a>), which will last for three and a half years. Antichrist will exalt himself above all gods and force people to worship him (<a href=Dan.htm#v8_9>Dan. 8:9</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v8_11>11</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v11_36>11:36</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v11_37>37</a>; <a href=2Th.htm#v2_3>2&nbsp;Thes. 2:3</a>-<a href=2Th.htm#v2_4>4</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v13_4>Rev. 13:4</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v13_6>6</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v13_12>12</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v13_14>14</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v13_15>15</a>). At that time, he will destroy the religious Babylon, the apostate Roman Catholic Church (<a href=Rev.htm#v17_16>17:16</a>). Hence, the religious Babylon will fall at the beginning of the great tribulation, whereas the material Babylon will fall at the end of the great tribulation (<a href=Rev.htm#v18_2>18:2</a>)."
