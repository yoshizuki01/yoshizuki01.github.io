BD["a1,\x99"]="<b>pot</b><br> &emsp; The arrangement of the furniture of the tabernacle portrays our experience of Christ. In the outer court were the bronze altar and the bronze laver (<a href=Exo.htm#v40_29>Exo. 40:29</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v40_32>32</a>). This signifies that our experience of Christ begins, in an outward sense, with His redemption, which was accomplished on the cross, and the cleansing of the Holy Spirit, which is based on Christ&rsquo;s redemption. In the Holy Place were the showbread table and the lampstand, with the incense altar located close to the Holy of Holies, in front of the Ark of the Testimony. The showbread table signifies our experience of Christ as our life supply, and the lampstand, our experience of Christ as the shining light. These experiences are rather inward, in the intellect and consciousness of our being. The incense altar signifies our experience of Christ as the sweet incense ascending to God. This experience is deeper and more inward, leading to the deepest and most inward experiences, in the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies was the Ark of the Testimony, in which were the golden pot containing the hidden manna; Aaron&rsquo;s budding rod; and the tablets of the covenant. The hidden manna in the golden pot signifies our experience of Christ as our life supply in the deepest way, an experience much deeper than that signified by the showbread table in the Holy Place. The budding rod signifies our experience of Christ in His resurrection as our acceptance by God for authority in the God-given ministry. This is deeper than the experience of Christ as the incense for our acceptance by God. The tablets of the covenant, which are the tablets of the Ten Commandments, signify our experience of Christ as the enlightening inner law, which regulates us according to God&rsquo;s divine nature. This is deeper than the experience of Christ as the shining lampstand in the Holy Place. All these deepest experiences of Christ take place in our spirit, signified by the Holy of Holies."

However, to the enemy she is as terrible as an army with banners. Banners indicate a readiness to fight and also are a sign that the victory is won. A terrible army signifies that the overcomers of the Lord terrify God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, and become terrible in the eyes of God&rsquo;s people. This army fights the battle for God&rsquo;s kingdom in the degradation of God&rsquo;s people to become the overcomers who answer the Lord&rsquo;s call (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_7>Rev. 2:7</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v2_11>11</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v2_17>17</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v2_26>26</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v3_5>3:5</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v3_12>12</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v3_21>21</a>).
