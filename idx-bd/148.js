The vision in <a href=Zec.htm#v3>ch. 3</a> concerning Joshua was to strengthen Joshua the high priest in the priesthood, whereas the vision of the golden lampstand and the two olive trees in this chapter was to strengthen Zerubbabel the governor of Judah in the kingship. In <a href=Zec.htm#v3>ch. 3</a> Joshua was measured (see <a href=ZecN.htm#n3_1x1P2>note 1<sup>1</sup>, par. 2</a>, there), resulting in his being strengthened and established through the cleansing.

BD["M+,\x97"]="<b>Remove</b><br> &emsp; The perfection of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah was extended to Joshua by the removing of the filthy garments from him, thus making his iniquity pass from him. Joshua was also clothed with stately robes, with garments befitting his office and status as high priest. These garments signify the expression of Christ in His divine glory and His human beauty (<a href=Exo.htm#v28_2>Exo. 28:2</a> and <a href=ExoN.htm#n28_2x1>notes</a>)."
BD["AM2\x97"]="<b>lived</b><br> &emsp; The revelation in this chapter shows that the unique way to have the Body, the church, and the house of God in the genuine oneness is the way of life. When the breath entered into the dead ones, it became life to them, and they lived and stood up in oneness to become an exceedingly great army. The dry bones and the two dead branches in vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v37_16>16</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v37_17>17</a> became one not by gifts or by teaching but by life. The dead bones and the dead branches were enlivened and became one as the issue of the dispensing of life and the growth in life (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v17_2>John 17:2</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v17_11>11</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v17_17>17</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v17_21>21</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v17_23>23</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v4_11>Eph. 4:11</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v4_16>16</a>)."

Just as Israel as God&rsquo;s Old Testament elect was involved with the nations, the church as God&rsquo;s New Testament elect is involved with the world in its many aspects. Jeremiah presents a vivid picture of God&rsquo;s punishment and judgment on the nations so that we may know how to have a clear separation from the world and not be mixed with any of its aspects (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_31>John 12:31</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v17_14>17:14</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v17_21>21</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v6_14>Gal. 6:14</a>; <a href=2Pe.htm#v1_4>2&nbsp;Pet. 1:4</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_15>1&nbsp;John 2:15</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_17>17</a>). God will come in to judge the world in all its aspects and to make a clear distinction between the church, which is today&rsquo;s Israel (<a href=Gal.htm#v6_16>Gal. 6:16</a> and <a href=GalN.htm#n6_16x4>note 4</a>), and every aspect of the world.<br> &emsp; Jeremiah prophesied concerning the nations because in His economy God needs them. On the one hand, God needs His chosen people to express Him; on the other hand, He needs another people, the nations, to behold and admire this expression, which is His masterpiece (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_10>Eph. 2:10</a>), the New Jerusalem. The nations around the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_24>Rev. 21:24</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_26>26</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_2>22:2b</a>) will eventually come from the nations concerning which Jeremiah and other Old Testament prophets prophesied."

As indicated by the movement of the horses, God&rsquo;s captured people were unsettled and were without peace, rest, and the enjoyment of life. The nations, on the contrary, were sitting still and were quiet (<a href=Zec.htm#v1_11>v. 11</a>). This indicates that, in the eyes of God, all the nations around Israel at that time were sitting and enjoying their life in peace and quietness while God&rsquo;s elect were suffering."

BD["?O))o63"]="<b>2.</b>&nbsp; In the fall of Jerusalem"
BD[">Y)\x97"]="<b>me</b><br> &emsp; Referring to Isaiah, the prophet of Jehovah, typifying Christ as the Servant of Jehovah (<a href=Mrk.htm#v10_45>Mark 10:45</a>) for God&rsquo;s speaking (<a href=Deu.htm#v18_15>Deut. 18:15</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_34>John 3:34</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v14_24>14:24</a>). Isaiah served Jehovah as His mouthpiece to speak forth His word, which is the embodiment of Himself (vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v49_1>1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v49_4>4</a>). Isaiah&rsquo;s prophesying helped in the release of Israel and the rebuilding of the temple and the city. Cyrus, the Gentile king, Israel, God&rsquo;s chosen people, and Isaiah, the prophet set up by God, all did the same thing to please God: they served to release God&rsquo;s people, to build up God&rsquo;s house, and to build up God&rsquo;s kingdom, signified by the city of Jerusalem. Thus, they all typify Christ as God&rsquo;s servant (<a href=Luk.htm#v4_18>Luke 4:18</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_19>19</a>). All who are in Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>) and who are thus one with Christ to release God&rsquo;s people and to build up His house and His kingdom are servants of God."
BD["AP)\x97"]="<b>In</b><br> &emsp; The three previous sections of this book, concerning the glory of the Lord (<a href=Ezk.htm#v1>ch. 1</a>), the judgment of God (chs. <a href=Ezk.htm#v2>2</a>&mdash;<a href=Ezk.htm#v32>32</a>), and the recovery of the Lord (chs. <a href=Ezk.htm#v33>33</a>&mdash;<a href=Ezk.htm#v39>39</a>), are all for the holy building of God (chs. <a href=Ezk.htm#v40>40</a>&mdash;<a href=Ezk.htm#v48>48</a>). God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to have a building as a mingling of Himself with His chosen people. Whatever God does among His people and among the nations on earth is for His building. This is confirmed by the book of Revelation, which is parallel to the book of Ezekiel and concludes with God&rsquo;s ultimate building, the New Jerusalem (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>Rev. 21:2</a>&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v22_5>22:5</a>).<br> &emsp; After the destruction of the temple built by Solomon (<a href=2Ki.htm#v25_8>2&nbsp;Kings 25:8</a>-<a href=2Ki.htm#v25_9>9</a>), the temple was rebuilt by the captives who returned from Babylon (<a href=Ezr.htm#v3_6>Ezra 3:6b</a>-<a href=Ezr.htm#v3_13>13</a>; <a href=Ezr.htm#v6_13>6:13</a>-<a href=Ezr.htm#v6_15>15</a>). Later, this temple was replaced by Herod&rsquo;s temple, which was built in forty-six years (<a href=Joh.htm#v2_20>John 2:20</a>). Herod&rsquo;s temple was destroyed in A.D. 70 by the Roman army under Titus (<a href=Dan.htm#v9_26>Dan. 9:26</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v23_38>Matt. 23:38</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v24_2>24:2</a>). Neither the temple in Ezra&rsquo;s day nor the temple of Herod&rsquo;s time was the full recovery of the temple built by Solomon. However, the temple of Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision was a more than full recovery of Solomon&rsquo;s temple. Although the temple itself was the same size as the one built by Solomon (<a href=Ezk.htm#v41_2>41:2</a>, <a href=Ezk.htm#v41_4>4</a>; cf. <a href=1Ki.htm#v6_2>1&nbsp;Kings 6:2</a>), a number of details related to the gates, the courts, and the buildings around the temple in Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision indicate an enlargement over Solomon&rsquo;s temple. Thus, beginning with Abraham&rsquo;s tent (see <a href=GenN.htm#n14_18x1>note 18<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v14>Gen. 14</a>), progressing to the tabernacle and then to Solomon&rsquo;s temple, and concluding with the temple in Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision, there is a continual progression in the enlargement of God&rsquo;s building in the Old Testament. This enlargement signifies a continual increase in the experience of Christ by God&rsquo;s people (cf. <a href=1KiN.htm#n6_20x1>note 20<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=1Ki.htm#v6>1&nbsp;Kings 6</a>). God&rsquo;s building in the Old Testament prefigures God&rsquo;s spiritual building in the New Testament, which begins with Jesus Christ, the incarnated God, as God&rsquo;s tabernacle (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>) and God&rsquo;s temple (<a href=Joh.htm#v2_19>John 2:19</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v2_21>21</a>), advances to the church, the Body of Christ, as the enlargement of Christ (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_22>Eph. 1:22</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>23</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_20>2:20</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>22</a>), and consummates with the New Jerusalem as the ultimate manifestation and enlargement of God&rsquo;s building in eternity (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>Rev. 21:2</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v21_15>15</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_17>17</a>).<br> &emsp; Literally, the visions concerning God&rsquo;s holy building in chs. <a href=Ezk.htm#v40>40</a>&mdash;<a href=Ezk.htm#v48>48</a> will be fulfilled in the restoration, when the restored Israel will rebuild the temple and the city of Jerusalem for their dwelling with God in the millennium. The spiritual significances of all the details should be applied to the New Testament believers as components of God&rsquo;s spiritual building, the church."
