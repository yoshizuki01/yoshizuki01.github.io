BD["O))\x97"]="<b>Jesus</b><br> &emsp; The first name and the last name (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_21>Rev. 22:21</a>) in the New Testament is Jesus, proving that Jesus Christ is the subject and content of the New Testament.<br> &emsp; The Bible is a book of life, and this life is a living person, the wonderful and all-inclusive Christ. The Old Testament gives a portrait, in types and prophecies, of this wonderful person as the Coming One. Now, in the New Testament, this wonderful person has come. The first page of the New Testament, in recommending this wonderful person to us, gives us His genealogy. This genealogy can be considered an abstract of the Old Testament, which in itself is the detailed genealogy of Christ. To understand the genealogy in Matthew, we need to trace the origin and history of every incident.<br> &emsp; Christ, as the wonderful center of the entire Bible, is all-inclusive, having many aspects. The New Testament at its beginning presents four biographies to portray the four main aspects of this all-inclusive Christ. The Gospel of Matthew testifies that He is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, who brings the kingdom of the heavens to the earth. The Gospel of Mark tells us that He is the Servant of God, laboring for God faithfully. Mark&rsquo;s account is most simple, for a servant does not warrant a detailed record. The Gospel of Luke presents a full picture of Him as the only proper and normal man who ever lived on this earth; as such a man, He is the Savior of mankind. The Gospel of John unveils Him as the Son of God, the very God Himself, who is life to God&rsquo;s people. Among the four Gospels, Matthew and Luke have a record of genealogy; Mark and John do not. To testify that Jesus is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, Matthew needs to show us the antecedents and status of this King, to prove that He is the proper successor to the throne of David. To prove that Jesus is a proper and normal man, Luke needs to show the generations of this man, to attest that He is qualified to be the Savior of mankind. For the record of a servant, Mark does not need to tell us His origin. To unveil that Jesus is the very God, neither does John need to give us His human genealogy; rather, he declares that, as the Word of God, He is the very God in the beginning.<br> &emsp; The kingdom, of which Christ is the King, is composed of Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, including both his descendants in the flesh and those in faith. Hence, the genealogy of Christ in Matthew begins with Abraham, the father of the called race, not with Adam, the father of the created race. God&rsquo;s kingdom is not built with the created race of Adam but with the called race of Abraham, which includes both the real Israelites (<a href=Rom.htm#v9_6>Rom. 9:6</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v9_8>8</a>) and the believers in Christ (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_7>Gal. 3:7</a>, <a href=Gal.htm#v3_9>9</a>, <a href=Gal.htm#v3_29>29</a>). To prove by relating His genealogy that Jesus is a proper man qualified to be the Savior of mankind, Luke traces His genealogy back to Adam, the first generation of mankind."

The vision here corresponds to that of Babylon the Great in <a href=Rev.htm#v18>Rev. 18</a>. The two visions show that in the sight of God the wickedness contained in commerce is a form of idolatry and fornication. Business is an adulterous woman desirous of making money."

BD["M,2\x97"]="<b>seven</b><br> &emsp; &ldquo;These seven,&rdquo; which are the eyes of Jehovah, are the seven eyes on the stone in <a href=Zec.htm#v3_9>3:9</a>. The seven eyes of the stone are the seven eyes of Jehovah and also the seven eyes of the Lamb, Christ (<a href=Rev.htm#v5_6>Rev. 5:6</a>). Thus, the stone, Jehovah, and the Lamb are one. Christ is the redeeming Lamb and the building stone, and He is also Jehovah. The seven eyes of Christ are the seven Spirits of God (see notes <a href=RevN.htm#n5_6x5>6<sup>5</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v5>Rev. 5</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n1_4x5>4<sup>5</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v1>Rev. 1</a>), indicating that Christ and the Holy Spirit, although distinct, are not separate. Just as a person&rsquo;s eyes are essentially one with the person, so the Holy Spirit is essentially one with Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_9>Rom. 8:9</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_10>10</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_17>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:17</a>). The function of Christ&rsquo;s seven eyes is to observe and search in order to execute God&rsquo;s judgment on the universe and to transfuse and infuse all that God is into His chosen people. In His resurrection Christ, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45b</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v6_63>John 6:63a</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_6>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:6b</a>), who is also the sevenfold intensified Spirit. This Spirit is the Spirit of life (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_2>Rom. 8:2</a>). Hence, the function of the seven Spirits is to impart the divine life into God&rsquo;s people for the building up of God&rsquo;s eternal habitation, the New Jerusalem."

In the outward recovery we repent, turn to the Lord, and are brought back to the enjoyment of Christ&rsquo;s riches and to God&rsquo;s blessing. In the inward recovery God touches our heart and our spirit and changes us in life and nature.<br> &emsp; In recovering His people, God acts on behalf of His holy name. The inward recovery by life is carried out not because of any merit in ourselves but because God does something in us for His own name (cf. <a href=2Ti.htm#v1_9>2&nbsp;Tim. 1:9</a>; <a href=Tit.htm#v3_5>Titus 3:5</a>)."
