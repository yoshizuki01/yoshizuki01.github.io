BD["OD;\x9c"]="<b>Father</b><br> &emsp; Matthew and John are the two books in which the Divine Trinity is revealed more fully than in all the other books of the Scripture, that God&rsquo;s chosen people may participate in and enjoy Him. For our experience of life, John unveils the mystery of the Godhead in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, especially in chs. <a href=Mat.htm#v14>14</a>&mdash;<a href=Mat.htm#v16>16</a>; whereas for the constituting of the kingdom, Matthew discloses the reality of the Divine Trinity by giving one name for all three. In the opening chapter of Matthew, the Holy Spirit (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_18>1:18</a>), Christ (the Son <a href=Mat.htm#v1_18>1:18</a>), and God (the Father&mdash;<a href=Mat.htm#v1_23>1:23</a>) are present for the producing of the man Jesus (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_21>1:21</a>), who, as Jehovah the Savior and God with us, is the very embodiment of the Triune God. In <a href=Mat.htm#v3>ch. 3</a> Matthew presents a scene in which the Son was standing in the water of baptism under the opened heaven, the Spirit like a dove descended upon the Son, and the Father spoke out of the heavens to the Son (<a href=Mat.htm#v3_16>3:16</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v3_17>17</a>). In <a href=Mat.htm#v12>ch. 12</a> the Son, in the person of man, cast out demons by the Spirit to bring in the kingdom of God the Father (<a href=Mat.htm#v12_28>12:28</a>). In <a href=Mat.htm#v16>ch. 16</a> the Father revealed the Son to the disciples for the building of the church, which is the life pulse of the kingdom (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_16>16:16</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_19>19</a>). In <a href=Mat.htm#v17>ch. 17</a> the Son entered into transfiguration (<a href=Mat.htm#v17_2>17:2</a>) and was confirmed by the Father&rsquo;s word of delight (<a href=Mat.htm#v17_5>17:5</a>), bringing about a miniature display of the manifestation of the kingdom (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_28>16:28</a>). Eventually, in the closing chapter, after Christ as the last Adam had passed through the process of crucifixion, entered into the realm of resurrection, and become the life-giving Spirit, He came back to His disciples in the atmosphere and reality of His resurrection to charge them to make the heathen the kingdom people by baptizing them into the name, the person, the reality, of the Divine Trinity. Later, in the Acts and the Epistles it is disclosed that to baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is to baptize them into the name of Christ (<a href=Act.htm#v8_16>Acts 8:16</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v19_5>19:5</a>), and that to baptize them into the name of Christ is to baptize them into Christ the person (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_27>Gal. 3:27</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v6_3>Rom. 6:3</a>), because Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and He, having become the life-giving Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>), is available at any time and in any place for people to be baptized into. According to Matthew, being baptized into the reality of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is for the constituting of the kingdom of the heavens. Unlike an earthly society, the heavenly kingdom cannot be formed with human beings of flesh and blood (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_50>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:50</a>); it can be constituted only with people who have been immersed into the union with the Triune God and who have been established and built up with the Triune God, who has been wrought into them."
