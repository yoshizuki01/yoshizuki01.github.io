BD["i*1\x9b"]="<b>synagogue</b><br> &emsp; The goal of God&rsquo;s economy is to have a unique temple on earth to testify of God and of the oneness of God&rsquo;s people. In the Old Testament, the place that God chose for the establishing of His unique temple was Jerusalem. Because God&rsquo;s people became fallen, divided, and scattered, numerous fallen, divided centers of worship were raised up; these became the synagogues. These synagogues were the places in which the Jews worshipped God mainly by studying their Scriptures, the Old Testament. However, because of their stubbornness in clinging to their traditional religious concepts, the Jews became one with Satan in opposing God&rsquo;s way of life, by which He fulfills His purpose. Under the manipulating, maneuvering hand of Satan, their synagogues opposed the Lord Jesus (<a href=Mat.htm#v12_9>Matt. 12:9</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v12_14>14</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v4_28>Luke 4:28</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v4_29>29</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v9_22>John 9:22</a>), then the apostles (<a href=Act.htm#v13_43>Acts 13:43</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v13_45>45</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v13_46>46</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v13_50>50</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v14_1>14:1</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v14_2>2</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v14_19>19</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v17_1>17:1</a>, <a href=Act.htm#v17_5>5</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v17_6>6</a>), and then the churches. Therefore, the Lord called them &ldquo;a synagogue of Satan.&rdquo; Even when He was on earth, He considered the synagogues to be of Satan, as implied in <a href=Mat.htm#v12_25>Matt. 12:25</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v12_29>29</a> and <a href=Joh.htm#v8_44>John 8:44</a>. Apparently, those in the synagogues were worshipping God; actually, they were opposing God. They persecuted and killed God&rsquo;s true worshippers, yet they considered that they were offering service to God (<a href=Joh.htm#v16_2>John 16:2</a>). Through all the centuries since then, religious people have followed in their steps, persecuting those who genuinely seek and follow the Lord in spirit and life, while still considering that they are defending the interests of God. Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, as well as Judaism, all fall into this category, having become an organization of Satan as his tool to damage God&rsquo;s economy."

BD["?78\x97"]="<b>ate</b><br> &emsp; According to the entire revelation in the Holy Bible, God&rsquo;s words are good for us to eat, and we need to eat them (<a href=Psa.htm#v119_103>Psa. 119:103</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v4_4>Matt. 4:4</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v5_12>Heb. 5:12</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v5_14>14</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_2>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:2</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_3>3</a>). God&rsquo;s word is the divine supply as food to nourish us. Through the word as our food, God dispenses His riches into our inner being to nourish us that we may be constituted with His element. This is a crucial aspect of God&rsquo;s economy. When we eat God&rsquo;s words, His word becomes our heart&rsquo;s gladness and joy."

God&rsquo;s appearing also implied that He wanted to help Job to know that he was in the wrong realm, the realm of building up himself as a man in the old creation in his perfection, uprightness, and integrity. Job glorified himself in these things, but God considered them frustrations to be stripped away so that Job might receive God in His nature, life, element, and essence and thus be metabolically transformed to be a God-man, a man in the new creation who expresses God and dispenses Him to others.<br> &emsp; God&rsquo;s dealing with Job in all the disasters and His stripping him of all that he was, were to take away his contentment in his godly attainments and obtainments and to remove all the barriers and coverings so that he could be emptied for some further seeking after God and could realize that what he was short of in his human life was God Himself. At the end of the book of Job, God came in to reveal Himself to Job, indicating that He Himself was what Job should pursue, gain, and express. In all God&rsquo;s dealings with Job, God&rsquo;s intention was to reduce Job to nothing, yet to maintain his existence (<a href=Job.htm#v2_6>2:6</a>) so that He might have time to impart Himself into Job."

BD["i,,\x98"]="<b>elders</b><br> &emsp; The elders here are not the elders of the church but the elders of the angels, because here, before the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, they are sitting on thrones already (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v19_28>Matt. 19:28</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>Rev. 20:4</a>). Among God&rsquo;s creation the angels are the most ancient ones. Their elders are the elders of the whole creation of God. That they sit on thrones with golden crowns on their heads indicates that they must be the ones who rule the universe until the millennial kingdom, when the authority to rule the earth will be given to the overcoming saints (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_5>Heb. 2:5</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v2_9>9</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v2_26>Rev. 2:26</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v2_27>27</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>20:4</a>). That they are clothed in white garments and have a harp and golden bowls full of incense (<a href=Rev.htm#v5_8>5:8</a>) indicates that now they are also priests before God; in the millennial kingdom, however, the reigning overcomers will be the priests of God and of Christ (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>20:6</a>). The elders&rsquo; golden crowns indicate that they are also ruling ones. Therefore, they are priests serving God and kings reigning over His creation."

BD["i*2\x98"]="<b>ten</b><br> &emsp; The number ten signifies fullness; e.g., the Ten Commandments, which express God&rsquo;s demand in full. Ten days signifies a period of time that is full, yet brief (<a href=Gen.htm#v24_55>Gen. 24:55</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v42_7>Jer. 42:7</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v1_12>Dan. 1:12</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v1_14>14</a>). Here it signifies that the affliction of the suffering church was full, yet short-lived. As a sign, the ten days here indicate prophetically the ten periods of persecution that the church suffered under the Roman emperors, beginning with Caesar Nero in the second half of the first century and ending with Constantine the Great in the first part of the fourth century. However severe were the persecutions instigated by the devil, Satan, through the Roman Caesars, who did their utmost to destroy and eliminate the church, they could not subdue and terminate the church. History demonstrates that the church of the living Christ, who became dead and lived again, withstood the persecutions victoriously and multiplied flourishingly by the indestructible resurrection life."

That the Lord is still the Son of Man after His ascension indicates that He has not put off His human nature after resurrection. His dealings here with the churches are based on His humanity.
