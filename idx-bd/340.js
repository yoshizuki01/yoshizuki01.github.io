These seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth, and they run to and fro through the whole earth (<a href=Zec.htm#v4_10>Zech. 4:10</a>).

This stone is Christ. Through His crucifixion Christ was cut by God by being put to death (<a href=Zec.htm#v3_9>Zech. 3:9</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v2_23>Acts 2:23</a>), and in His resurrection (<a href=Act.htm#v2_24>Acts 2:24</a>) He was cut out to be a stone in three aspects: the foundation stone and the cornerstone for the building up of the church (<a href=Isa.htm#v28_16>Isa. 28:16</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v21_42>Matt. 21:42</a>), the stumbling stone to the unbelieving Jews (<a href=Isa.htm#v8_14>Isa. 8:14</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v21_44>Matt. 21:44a</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v9_33>Rom. 9:33</a>), and the crushing stone to destroy the totality of human government (<a href=Mat.htm#v21_44>Matt. 21:44b</a>).<br> &emsp; When Christ comes as the crushing stone, He will not come alone; rather, He will come with His overcomers, His bride, His increase, as His army (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_29>John 3:29</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_30>30</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v17_14>Rev. 17:14</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v19_7>19:7</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v19_8>8</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v19_11>11</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v19_14>14</a>).

After His wedding, He as the Husband will come with His newlywed bride to destroy Antichrist, who with his army will fight against God directly (<a href=Rev.htm#v17_14>Rev. 17:14</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v19_19>19:19</a>)."
