Hence, to profane the Sabbath was a serious matter in the eyes of the religious Pharisees. To them it was not lawful, not scriptural. But they did not have adequate knowledge of the Scriptures. Based on their meager knowledge, they cared for the ritual of keeping the Sabbath, not for the hunger of the people. What folly to observe a vain ritual!"

To be born anew is to be regenerated with the divine life, a life different from the human life received by natural birth. Hence, his real need was not better teachings by which he could improve himself, but the divine life by which he could be remade. He was seeking for teachings, which belong to the tree of knowledge, but the Lord&rsquo;s answer turned him to his need for life, which belongs to the tree of life (cf. <a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>Gen. 2:9</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v2_17>17</a>)."

Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah will come to tread the winepress to save Israel from the nations (vv. <a href=Isa.htm#v63_1>1</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v63_6>6</a>). During the last three and a half years of this age, the time of the great tribulation (<a href=Mat.htm#v24_21>Matt. 24:21</a>), Antichrist will persecute the Jews to the uttermost, with the intention of completely destroying Israel. Prior to that time, nearly all Israel will be brought back to the Holy Land. Then, before the tribulation Antichrist will make a seven-year covenant of peace with Israel so that they may have their freedom (<a href=Dan.htm#v9_27>Dan. 9:27</a>). But after three and a half years, Antichrist will change his mind and will oppose every kind of religion (<a href=Dan.htm#v11_36>Dan. 11:36</a>). After destroying Catholicism (<a href=Rev.htm#v17_16>Rev. 17:16</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v17_18>18</a>), Antichrist will attempt to destroy the Jewish religion. At the end of the last three and a half years, Antichrist will cause the armies of the nations to surround Jerusalem. With Jerusalem as the center, the entire region from Bozrah to the Mount of Megiddo (Armageddon&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v16_16>Rev. 16:16</a>) will be occupied by armies. In His coming back, Christ, with His overcomers as His bride, will descend to Bozrah (<a href=Isa.htm#v63_1>v. 1</a>), and beginning there He will tread the winepress, destroying all the armies. In this way He will rescue Israel from destruction. See <a href=Rev.htm#v14_17>Rev. 14:17</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v14_20>20</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v16_16>16:16</a>; and <a href=Rev.htm#v19_11>19:11</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v19_21>21</a>, and <a href=RevN.htm#n19_11x1>notes</a> on those verses."
BD["O->\x9a"]="<b>judgment</b><br> &emsp; In this verse there are three kinds of judgments. The first is the judgment at the gate of the city, which is the district judgment. The second is the judgment by the Sanhedrin, which is a higher judgment. The third is the judgment by God through the Gehenna of fire, which is the highest judgment. These three kinds of judgments were mentioned here by the new King, who used figures from the Jewish background because His entire audience was Jewish. However, in regard to the kingdom people, the believers of the New Testament, all these judgments refer to the judgment of the Lord at the judgment seat of Christ, as revealed in <a href=2Co.htm#v5_10>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:10</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v14_10>Rom. 14:10</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v14_12>12</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v4_4>1&nbsp;Cor. 4:4</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v4_5>5</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v3_13>3:13</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_15>15</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v16_27>Matt. 16:27</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_12>Rev. 22:12</a>; and <a href=Heb.htm#v10_27>Heb. 10:27</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v10_30>30</a>. This clearly reveals that the New Testament believers, although forgiven by God forever, are still liable to the Lord&rsquo;s judgment, a judgment not for perdition but for discipline, if they sin against the new law of the kingdom as given here. However, when we sin against the new law of the kingdom, we will be forgiven and cleansed by the blood of the Lord Jesus if we repent and confess our sins (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_7>1&nbsp;John 1:7</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_9>9</a>)."
