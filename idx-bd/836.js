After John the Baptist sounded the trumpet of repentance (<a href=Mat.htm#v3_1>Matt. 3:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v3_2>2</a>), the Lord Jesus came as the Shepherd (<a href=Mat.htm#v9_36>Matt. 9:36</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v15_1>Luke 15:1</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v15_7>7</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v10_11>John 10:11</a>)."

The stubbornness of the children of Israel in sinning against God was due to their not being one with God. If they had been one with God, they would have received God&rsquo;s word and would have known His heart, His nature, His mind, and His purpose. Furthermore, they would have spontaneously lived Him and would have been constituted with Him to be His testimony on earth. Those who are not one with God do not take His will and good pleasure but express their opinions and pursue their preferences. To do this is to forsake God as the source, the fountain, of living waters and to hew out broken cisterns that can hold no water (<a href=Jer.htm#v2_13>2:13</a>). Cf. <a href=JerN.htm#n40_14x1>note 14<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Jer.htm#v40>ch. 40</a>."
