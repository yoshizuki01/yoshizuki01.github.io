Since it is at the fifth trumpet that Satan falls from heaven to damage the earth and persecute the people of God for three and a half years (<a href=Rev.htm#v12_10>12:10</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v12_12>12</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v12_17>17</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v12_6>6</a>); and since it is at the same time (the last three and a half years) that Antichrist comes up out of the abyss to collaborate with Satan to torment people, persecute the saints, and blaspheme God (<a href=Rev.htm#v13_5>13:5</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v13_7>7</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v11_7>11:7</a>); and since it is in the same three and a half years that the holy city, Jerusalem, is given over to the Gentiles for destruction (<a href=Rev.htm#v11_2>11:2</a>), the woe of the fifth trumpet must be the beginning of the most severe woes of the great tribulation (<a href=Mat.htm#v24_21>Matt. 24:21</a>; see <a href=RevN.htm#n11_2x4>note 2<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v11>ch. 11</a>). The second woe, the woe of the sixth trumpet, and the third woe, the woe of the seventh trumpet (<a href=Rev.htm#v8_13>8:13</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v9_12>9:12</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v11_14>11:14</a>), must also be two parts of the most severe woes of the great tribulation. These three woes, with the damage from the sixth seal and the first four trumpets, will be a trial upon all those who dwell on the earth (<a href=Rev.htm#v3_10>3:10</a>)."
