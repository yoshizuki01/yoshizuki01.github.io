A portion of these holy gifts was separated for God Himself to enjoy, and the remainder was for the people&rsquo;s enjoyment. The high priest was responsible to ensure that this most holy portion, the portion separated to God, was entirely for Him and was not touched by anyone who was not a priest. If anyone transgressed the ordinance of God&rsquo;s holiness concerning this portion, the high priest was to bear the iniquity of it. For this reason he wore the gold plate that declared HOLINESS TO JEHOVAH. This signifies that as our High Priest, Christ bears the responsibility to make God&rsquo;s people holy in the highest degree and to guard for God the holiness that is in them (cf. <a href=Eph.htm#v1_4>Eph. 1:4</a>; <a href=1Th.htm#v3_13>1&nbsp;Thes. 3:13</a>; <a href=1Th.htm#v5_23>5:23</a>)."

By His first coming the Lord accomplished His death to carry out an all-inclusive redemption for the producing of the church. After His death He went away to receive the kingdom, and He will come again with the kingdom (<a href=Dan.htm#v7_13>Dan. 7:13</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v7_14>14</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v19_12>Luke 19:12</a>). The period between His first and second comings is the church age. The church thus bridges the gap between the Lord&rsquo;s first coming and His second coming and connects His death in the past with God&rsquo;s kingdom in the future. Hence, to declare the Lord&rsquo;s death until He comes may imply the declaring of the existence of the church for the bringing in of the kingdom. When we eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper in this way, with a view to a continual remembrance of Him in His first and second comings, that supper becomes a satisfaction to Him in relation to the kingdom, God&rsquo;s administration."

In everything related to David, God was sovereign. As the sovereign One, God is above everything, behind everything, and in everything. In His sovereignty God prepared David to be a man according to His heart for His kingdom. He also prepared Saul to perfect David by testing him and putting him on trial, and He prepared Jonathan, the son of Saul, and Michal, the daughter of Saul who became David&rsquo;s wife, to help David to flee from Saul. Apart from the help rendered by Jonathan and Michal, David could not have endured being persecuted and tried by Saul. Both Jonathan and Michal typify Christ as God&rsquo;s provision for us to suffer God&rsquo;s trial and God&rsquo;s testing.<br> &emsp; When David was persecuted by Saul, he did not react in a negative way, nor did he complain, condemn, criticize, or oppose. Using the New Testament term, he was always under the cross. He bore the cross every day under any kind of situation (<a href=Luk.htm#v9_23>Luke 9:23</a>). The strength for us to bear the cross is the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_10>Phil. 3:10</a>), which is Christ Himself as the resurrection (<a href=Joh.htm#v11_25>John 11:25</a>).

The three feasts in the second group took place in the seventh month of the year, signifying the time of Christ&rsquo;s second coming. According to their dispensational fulfillment, the first four have taken place already, and the last three will take place in the future.

The Feast of Unleavened Bread is being fulfilled in the church age (<a href=1Co.htm#v5_7>1&nbsp;Cor. 5:7</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v5_8>8</a>). The Feast of Firstfruits was fulfilled on the day of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_20>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:20</a>), when the members of Christ were produced for the formation of the church (<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_3>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:3</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_6>Eph. 2:6</a>). The Feast of Pentecost was fulfilled fifty days after Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, on the day of the pouring out of the Holy Spirit (<a href=Act.htm#v2_1>Acts 2:1</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v2_4>4</a>; cf. <a href=Act.htm#v1_3>Acts 1:3</a>), when the resurrected and ascended Christ as the consummated, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit poured Himself out on His members to form the church. The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets will be fulfilled at Christ&rsquo;s second coming (<a href=Mat.htm#v24_31>Matt. 24:31</a>). The Feast of Expiation will be fulfilled on the day of Israel&rsquo;s return to God, after they have been gathered back to their fathers&rsquo; land (<a href=Rom.htm#v11_26>Rom. 11:26</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v11_27>27</a>; <a href=Zec.htm#v12_10>Zech. 12:10</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v12_14>14</a>). The Feast of Tabernacles will be fulfilled in the coming millennium for a thousand years (<a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>Rev. 20:4</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>) as a conclusion of all the ages of God&rsquo;s old creation, for the coming of the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem as their center (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_1>Rev. 21:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>2</a>)."
