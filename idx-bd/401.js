Throughout the centuries God has maintained the cause of His people Israel. When they were wrong with Him, He chastised them and disciplined them through the hands of the Gentile powers, including the Babylonian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman empires. But when these nations went too far in dealing with Israel, God maintained Israel&rsquo;s cause, punishing those who mistreated them (see <a href=IsaN.htm#n10_5x1>note 5<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Isa.htm#v10>Isa. 10</a> and <a href=IsaN.htm#n26_13x1P1>note 13<sup>1</sup>, par. 1</a>, in <a href=Isa.htm#v26>Isa. 26</a>). This indicates that behind the physical realm there is the spiritual realm, in which God governs the entire universe, executing justice for His people every day as each day requires. God does this for His elect, for both Israel and the believers in Christ (<a href=1Pe.htm#v4_17>1&nbsp;Pet. 4:17</a> and <a href=1PeN.htm#n4_17x1>note 1</a>)."

BD["9,0\x97"]="<b>iniquity</b><br> &emsp; The contents of the book of Job are the expressions of the sentiments of godly men, including Job, his three friends, and the young man Elihu, plus the speaking of God. The expressions of the sentiments of the five godly men were according to the experiences of their godly life and were based on human concepts concerning the relationship between God and man. They were uttered before the law was given, yet they were filled with the principle of good and evil. The logic of the speakers was according to the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (<a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>Gen. 2:9</a>), and, based on this, they considered God&rsquo;s justice and righteous judgment very much. Much of their debate in this book resulted from their different views concerning God&rsquo;s judgment. Job&rsquo;s friends thought that what he was suffering was a matter of God&rsquo;s judgment. However, Job&rsquo;s sufferings were not God&rsquo;s judgment but God&rsquo;s stripping and consuming that God might gain Job so that he might gain God more. See <a href=JobN.htm#n9_15x1>note 15<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Job.htm#v9>ch. 9</a> and <a href=JobN.htm#n10_13x1P2>note 13<sup>1</sup>, par. 2</a>, in <a href=Job.htm#v10>ch. 10</a>.<br> &emsp; Although they contradict God&rsquo;s purpose for man, the words of Job, his three friends, and Elihu were recorded under the inspiration of the Spirit of God to serve God&rsquo;s purpose of exposing the mistake of these five godly men in their knowing of God. Thus, man may be enlightened to realize that, according to the good pleasure of God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, man should be filled with God to be the expression of God only, rather than the expression of man&rsquo;s perfection in his uprightness and integrity."

BD["9+3\x97"]="<b>die</b><br> &emsp; Job&rsquo;s experience of God&rsquo;s consuming and stripping in the Old Testament was far behind that of Paul in the New Testament. First, God stripped Job of his possessions (<a href=Job.htm#v1_13>1:13</a>-<a href=Job.htm#v1_19>19</a>), and then God consumed him by his suffering of the plague on his body (<a href=Job.htm#v2_7>2:7</a>). In the New Testament God&rsquo;s consuming and stripping become pleasant things. From the day he was converted, Paul was a person under God&rsquo;s consuming and God&rsquo;s stripping (<a href=2Co.htm#v4_8>2&nbsp;Cor. 4:8</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v4_18>18</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v3_7>Phil. 3:7</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_8>8</a>). However, when Paul was suffering distresses for the sake of Christ, he was well pleased (<a href=2Co.htm#v12_10>2&nbsp;Cor. 12:10</a>), and he even rejoiced in the Lord for his experiences (<a href=Col.htm#v1_24>Col. 1:24</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v4_4>Phil. 4:4</a>). In contrast, Job did not rejoice but was constantly vexed.<br> &emsp; In his experience of God&rsquo;s consuming and stripping, Paul was not constricted by the pressures on every side and did not perish despite his being cast down (<a href=2Co.htm#v4_8>2&nbsp;Cor. 4:8</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v4_9>9</a>). He did not lose heart, but he expected to be put to death that he might manifest Christ&rsquo;s life, and to be consumed day by day that he might be renewed and, through the momentary lightness of his affliction, add to the eternal weight of glory that he would share in the ages to come (<a href=2Co.htm#v4_10>2&nbsp;Cor. 4:10</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v4_12>12</a>, <a href=2Co.htm#v4_16>16</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v4_17>17</a>; cf. <a href=Rom.htm#v8_18>Rom. 8:18</a>). Unlike Job, Paul did not curse the day of his birth, and he did not say that he preferred to die rather than to live. On the contrary, after much consideration Paul said that he still preferred to live, not to die, because to him to live was Christ (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>Phil. 1:21</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v1_25>25</a>). Paul&rsquo;s living Christ was for him to magnify Christ, whether through life or through death, by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_19>Phil. 1:19</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v1_20>20</a>). He did not care for life or death; he cared only to live Christ for His magnification. When God created man, this is the kind of life He wanted man to live."
