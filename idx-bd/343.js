BD["M+1\x97"]="<b>stone</b><br> &emsp; This stone (Zerubbabel) set before Joshua also typifies Christ as the stone for God&rsquo;s building (<a href=Psa.htm#v118_22>Psa. 118:22</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v28_16>Isa. 28:16</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v21_42>Matt. 21:42</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v2_4>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:4</a>). Zerubbabel was a stone set before Joshua to carry out God&rsquo;s economy."
BD["L*=\x97"]="<b>Zerubbabel</b><br> &emsp; Verses <a href=Hag.htm#v2_20>20</a>-<a href=Hag.htm#v2_23>23</a> are the promise concerning the Messiah (typified by Zerubbabel) in the coming kingdom. Jehovah&rsquo;s making Zerubbabel as a signet ring (<a href=Hag.htm#v2_23>v. 23</a>) indicates that Jehovah regarded him as His representative and that He loved him and trusted him. In this matter Zerubbabel is a type of Christ. He represents God (<a href=Mat.htm#v28_18>Matt. 28:18</a>), and He is the One whom God loves and trusts (<a href=Mat.htm#v3_17>Matt. 3:17</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v17_5>17:5</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_35>John 3:35</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v17_2>17:2</a>). As such a person, He is qualified to take care of the building of God&rsquo;s house, the church (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>)."

BD["AP.\x97"]="<b>gate</b><br> &emsp; The gate is divided into four sections: an outer threshold (<a href=Ezk.htm#v40_6>v. 6</a>), a passage (a court, <a href=Ezk.htm#v40_14>v. 14</a>), an inner threshold (<a href=Ezk.htm#v40_7>v. 7</a>), and a porch (vv. <a href=Ezk.htm#v40_8>8</a>-<a href=Ezk.htm#v40_9>9</a>). As the entrance to God&rsquo;s building, the gate signifies Christ as the gateway for us to enter into God and into God&rsquo;s interests, God&rsquo;s building, and God&rsquo;s kingdom (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_6>John 14:6</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v14_20>20</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_21>Rev. 21:21a</a>). Whereas the wall separates sinners from God, the gate brings people into God and into God&rsquo;s building. See <a href=RevN.htm#n21_21x1>note 21<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v21>Rev. 21</a>."
BD["M-+\x97"]="<b>curse</b><br> &emsp; The curse signifies God&rsquo;s punishment in judging sins according to His righteous law (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_13>Gal. 3:13a</a>). The fact that God&rsquo;s judgment is a curse indicates that it is a very serious matter."
BD["AJ\@\x97"]="<b>Prince</b><br> &emsp; When the Lord Jesus comes as the Shepherd to care for us, He comes also as the King to govern us. The issue of the Lord&rsquo;s caring for us as our Shepherd is that we obey Him as our King and come under His kingship and His throne within us."

The prophet Zechariah spoke this word to Zerubbabel in order to support, encourage, strengthen, and establish the hand of Zerubbabel that he might continue the building of the temple unto its consummation."
