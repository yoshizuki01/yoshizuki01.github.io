These three servants and the all-inclusive Christ are one, serving Jehovah God for His good pleasure in releasing and raising up God&rsquo;s elect to build God&rsquo;s temple and God&rsquo;s city and to set up God&rsquo;s kingdom, which will be enlarged to consummate in the New Jerusalem.<br> &emsp; In the first forty chapters of this book Isaiah unveiled in a hidden way God&rsquo;s economy, which is to have a people so that Christ as the embodiment of God can be expressed as everything, that He may be the centrality and the universality of everything in God&rsquo;s economy (see <a href=IsaN.htm#n22_25x1>note 25<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Isa.htm#v22>ch. 22</a>). God in Christ and Christ with God have reached this point, i.e., to have Christ expressed as God&rsquo;s centrality and universality, to such an extent that these three parties&mdash;Cyrus the Gentile king, the pitiful Israel, and Isaiah&mdash;became one with Christ that God might have a corporate expression. Everyone who is one with Christ, including the New Testament believers, is a type of Christ, who is the Servant of God, and such persons also are servants of God because they are part of Christ. All other persons have been terminated, put aside by God. Those who are one with Christ have become a great corporate Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_12>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:12</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v3_10>Col. 3:10</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v3_11>11</a>), the same as the individual Christ in being the testimony and servant of God."
