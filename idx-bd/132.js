BD["i,-\x97"]="<b>seven</b><br> &emsp; The seven lamps here are based upon the seven lamps of the lampstand in <a href=Exo.htm#v25_37>Exo. 25:37</a> and <a href=Zec.htm#v4_2>Zech. 4:2</a>. The seven lamps of fire, which are the seven Spirits of God, signify the enlightening and searching of the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God. In <a href=Exo.htm#v25>Exo. 25</a> and <a href=Zec.htm#v4>Zech. 4</a> the seven lamps, signifying the enlightening of the Spirit of God in God&rsquo;s move, are for God&rsquo;s building, either for the building of the tabernacle or for the rebuilding of the temple. Here the seven lamps are for God&rsquo;s judgment, which will issue also in God&rsquo;s building&mdash;the building of the New Jerusalem."

BD["i+0\x97"]="<b>opened</b><br> &emsp; As the One who has the key of David and who opens and no one will shut, the Lord has given the recovered church an opened door, which no one can shut. Since the recovery of the proper church life began, in the early part of the nineteenth century, until now, a door has always been opened wide to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The more organized Christianity tries to shut the door, the wider it is opened. In spite of much opposition, today the door is open worldwide. The key is in the hand of the Head of the church; it is not in the hand of the opposers."
BD["i)5\x9a"]="<b>girded</b><br> &emsp; The priests in the Old Testament were girded at the loins for their ministry (<a href=Exo.htm#v28_4>Exo. 28:4</a>). In <a href=Dan.htm#v10_5>Dan. 10:5</a> Christ also is girded at His loins, with fine gold. But here Christ as our High Priest is girded about at the breasts. The breasts signify love. To be girded at the loins is to be strengthened for the work, whereas to be girded about at the breasts signifies care in love. Christ&rsquo;s work in producing the churches has been accomplished. He no longer needs to be girded at His loins for the work. What He is doing now in the midst of the churches is to care for them in love. This requires that He be girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle. The golden girdle signifies the divine strength. Christ is moving in the churches to care for them in His humanity and with His divine strength."
