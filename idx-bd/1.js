BD["e-1\x97"]="<b>testimony</b><br> &emsp; The testimony by the water, the blood, and the Spirit that Jesus is the Son of God is the testimony of God, which is greater than that of men."
BD["a5=\x97"]="<b>doing</b><br> &emsp; God is doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ that we may be able to do His will. God works in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure (<a href=Phi.htm#v2_13>Phil. 2:13</a>). From beginning to end this book presents to us a heavenly Christ.

BD["A)3\x99"]="<b>covered</b><br> &emsp; The wings of an eagle are not only for moving but also for protection. Whatever we do and whatever we are must be by the grace of the Lord and the power of the Lord (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_10>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:10</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v1_12>2&nbsp;Cor. 1:12</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v4_7>4:7</a>).

This indicates that we must always express ourselves like a normal man; but the moving and overshadowing wings should give others an impression of the Divine Being, an impression that we have God with us as our power and protection."
