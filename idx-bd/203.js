When we take Christ as our heavenly life supply, Christ as the hidden manna preserved in the divine nature within us causes us to correspond to God&rsquo;s testimony and to fulfill its requirements (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_4>Rom. 8:4</a>), thereby making us God&rsquo;s expression."

This indicates that the experience of Christ, who is the reality of the good land (<a href=Col.htm#v1_12>Col. 1:12</a>), among God&rsquo;s people is not the same. Because the tribes were different, in His wisdom God allotted the different tribes particular portions of the land according to what they were (<a href=Gen.htm#v49_3>Gen. 49:3</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v49_28>28</a> and <a href=GenN.htm#n49_4x1>notes</a>). The fulfillment of the type of the allotment of the land is seen in the fact that all the believers in Christ possess the same Christ, but they experience the one Christ in different ways according to what they are (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_3>Rom. 12:3</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v12_4>4</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v4_7>Eph. 4:7</a>).

BD["O<9\x8c"]="And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside privately, and on the way He said to them,"

BD["O;<\x8c"]="The young man said to Him, All these things I have kept. What do I still lack?"
BD["T.6\x8c"]="For sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace."
BD["O:?\x8c"]="For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to settle accounts with his slaves."
BD["T-9\x8c"]="For if, by the offense of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ."
BD["(=D\x97"]="<b>seven</b><br> &emsp; Abraham redeemed the well at the cost of seven ewe lambs. In typology the seven ewe lambs signify the full redemption of Christ, indicating that the divine living water has been redeemed, bought back, by Christ&rsquo;s full redemption (<a href=Joh.htm#v19_34>John 19:34</a>)."
BD["O9B\x8c"]="And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, So then the sons are free."
BD["T,<\x8c"]="But with regard to the promise of God, he did not doubt in unbelief, but was empowered by faith, giving glory to God"
BD["T+?\x8c"]="For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,"
BD["O7H\x8c"]="And Jesus called His disciples to <I>Him</I> and said, I am moved with compassion for the crowd, because for three days now they have remained with Me and they do not have anything to eat. And I am not willing to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
BD["T*B\x8c"]="If therefore the uncircumcision keeps the ordinances of the law, will not his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?"
BD["O6K\x8c"]="And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent <I>word</I> into all that surrounding region and brought to Him all who were ill."

BD["O4Q\x8c"]="Ninevite men will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something more than Jonah is here."

BD["U-,\x98"]="<b>my</b><br> &emsp; The apostle&rsquo;s spirit was so strong that it attended the meeting of the Corinthian believers. His spirit was assembled with them to carry out his judgment upon the evil person."
BD["P88\x98"]="<b>not</b><br> &emsp; Here the verse does not say, &ldquo;He who does not believe and is not baptized.&rdquo; This indicates that condemnation is related only to not believing; it is not related to not being baptized. Believing, by itself, is sufficient in order to receive salvation from condemnation; yet for the completion of one&rsquo;s inward salvation, believing needs baptism as an outward affirmation."
BD["*\@)\x97"]="<b>saying</b><br> &emsp; Verses <a href=Lev.htm#v24_1>1</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v24_9>9</a> unveil that for us, the holy people of God, to live a holy life, we need the arranging afresh of Christ as the divine light to shine over us and as the divine food to nourish us."
BD["U+2\x98"]="<b>take</b><br> &emsp; The church, the house of God, must be built with gold, silver, and precious stones, precious materials produced from Christ&rsquo;s growing in us. Yet there is a great possibility that we may build with wood, grass, and stubble produced by us in the flesh. Hence, each of us, every member of the Body, must take heed how he builds, that is, with what material he builds."
BD["S<))o123"]="<b>c.</b>&nbsp; Through Macedonia and Greece to Troas"
BD["*?,\x97"]="<b>feasts</b><br> &emsp; There were seven annual feasts. Seven is the number of fullness, signifying that the seven annual feasts were in the fullness of God&rsquo;s riches. Christ is the reality of the Sabbath (<a href=Lev.htm#v23_3>v. 3</a>) and of all the annual feasts (<a href=Col.htm#v2_16>Col. 2:16</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v2_17>17</a>)."
BD["U*5\x98"]="<b>with</b><br> &emsp; The thought here is to speak spiritual things with spiritual words. The stress is not on the person to whom the speaking is done but on the means by which the spiritual things are spoken. The apostle spoke the spiritual things, which are the deep things of God concerning Christ, with spiritual words, which are the spiritual words taught by the Spirit."
BD["Q;*\x8c"]="And behold, <I>there</I> <I>was</I> a man whose name was called Zaccheus; and he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich."
BD["P6>\x98"]="<b>eating</b><br> &emsp; This was the eating of the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s supper, after He and His followers had eaten the passover feast in vv. <a href=Mrk.htm#v14_16>16</a>-<a href=Mrk.htm#v14_18>18</a>. He initiated this new feast, which was for His believers&rsquo; remembrance of Him, to replace the passover feast, the old testament feast for the elect&rsquo;s remembrance of Jehovah&rsquo;s salvation (<a href=Exo.htm#v12_14>Exo. 12:14</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v13_3>13:3</a>). This new feast of the new testament is for the remembering of the Slave-Savior through the eating of the bread, which signifies His body given for His believers (<a href=1Co.htm#v11_24>1&nbsp;Cor. 11:24</a>), and the drinking of the cup, which signifies His blood shed for their sins (<a href=Mat.htm#v26_28>Matt. 26:28</a>). The bread denotes life (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_35>John 6:35</a>), the life of God, the eternal life, and the cup denotes blessing (<a href=1Co.htm#v10_16>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:16</a>), which is God Himself as the believers&rsquo; portion (<a href=Psa.htm#v16_5>Psa. 16:5</a>). As sinners, the believers should have had the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath as their portion (<a href=Rev.htm#v14_10>Rev. 14:10</a>). But the Slave-Savior drank that cup for them (<a href=Joh.htm#v18_11>John 18:11</a>), and His salvation became their portion, the cup of salvation (<a href=Psa.htm#v116_13>Psa. 116:13</a>) that runs over (<a href=Psa.htm#v23_5>Psa. 23:5</a>), the content of which is God as the believers&rsquo; all-inclusive blessing. Such a bread and such a cup are the constituents of the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s supper, which is a table (<a href=1Co.htm#v10_21>1&nbsp;Cor. 10:21</a>), a feast, set up by Him that His believers may remember Him by enjoying Him as such a feast. Thus, as His believers remember Him, they display His redeeming and life-imparting death (<a href=1Co.htm#v11_26>1&nbsp;Cor. 11:26</a>&mdash;His blood separated from His body declares His death), testifying to the entire universe of His rich and marvelous salvation."

To put on the priestly garments signifies that we should live a life that befits our priestly service. Not letting the hair go loose signifies that we submit to God&rsquo;s authority and are not disobedient, unrestrained, or disorderly in our actions. Not tearing one&rsquo;s clothes (signifying one&rsquo;s behavior&mdash;<a href=Rev.htm#v19_8>Rev. 19:8</a>) signifies that we should not make ourselves bankrupt in morality."
BD["V,*\x8c"]="But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God."
