The crucial point of this book is that the very God who chose Israel, the descendants of Abraham, as His elect, after He gave them into captivity to the Gentile nations, became a hidden God to them to take care of them secretly and save them openly while acting in secrecy (<a href=Isa.htm#v45_15>Isa. 45:15</a>). This is the reason this book does not mention the name of God even in places when the name of God should be mentioned (<a href=Est.htm#v4_3>4:3</a>, <a href=Est.htm#v4_16>16</a>).<br> &emsp; The account in the book of Esther is crucial in relation to the following matters: (1) for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s calling of Abraham for a land, a seed (a people), and a blessing to all the nations (<a href=Gen.htm#v12_1>Gen. 12:1</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v12_3>3</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v22_17>22:17</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v22_18>18</a>); (2) for the fulfillment of the promise of God given through Moses that after God gave Israel into captivity, He would still take care of them (<a href=Deu.htm#v4_27>Deut. 4:27</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v4_31>31</a>); (3) for the fulfillment of the prayer of Solomon on the day of the dedication of the temple that God would take care of His elect in their captivity (<a href=1Ki.htm#v8_46>1&nbsp;Kings 8:46</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v8_53>53</a>); (4) for the keeping of the line of the genealogy of Christ through the survival of Israel in their captivity that Christ might be brought into the human race; and (5) to keep a people for the possessing of the Holy Land as a base for Christ to come back to establish His kingdom on earth."

Therefore, there was the need for an Ezra, one who was both a priest who served God and also a scribe, a scholar, who was skilled in the Word of God, skilled in the law of Moses.

Hence, according to the New Testament principle, for women not to be permitted to speak in the church meetings means that women are not permitted to teach with authority in relation to the defining of doctrine. In this sense they should be silent in the church meetings. They are not permitted to speak, because they should be subject to men. This is related to the matter of authority ordained by God in His government. In God&rsquo;s governmental ordination, women are not permitted to speak with authority over men. They may pray and prophesy, that is, (mainly) speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord. However, they must do this under the covering of the brothers, because they are charged here to be subject."

These books also show that God&rsquo;s people need to be disciplined by passing through certain difficulties and undergoing different kinds of frustrations. In <a href=Exo.htm#v12>Exo. 12</a>&mdash;<a href=Exo.htm#v14>14</a> Israel as God&rsquo;s people was redeemed from God&rsquo;s judgment by the passover and saved from Egypt by the saving power of the Triune God. Then, they enjoyed the heavenly provision and the divine care in their initial journey in the wilderness (<a href=Exo.htm#v15>Exo. 15</a>&mdash;<a href=Exo.htm#v17>17</a>). In <a href=Exo.htm#v19>Exo. 19</a>&mdash;<a href=Exo.htm#v40>40</a> and <a href=Lev.htm#v1>Lev. 1</a>&mdash;<a href=Lev.htm#v27>27</a> they received the divine revelation and training in knowing God, in being built up together with God as His dwelling on earth for His expression and testimony, and in the building up of the priesthood for the divine service. All this took place at the foot of Mount Sinai, where the people were given the law as a portrait of what God is in His attributes. The book of Numbers records how God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people were formed into a priestly army to journey with God and to fight with God for His interest on earth (chs. <a href=Num.htm#v1>1</a>&mdash;<a href=Num.htm#v4>4</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v9_15>9:15</a>&mdash;<a href=Num.htm#v10_36>10:36</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v12_16>12:16</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v20_1>20:1</a>&mdash;<a href=Num.htm#v21_35>21:35</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v31_1>31:1</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v31_54>54</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v33_1>33:1</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v33_49>49</a>). In Numbers the children of Israel also passed through various frustrations, trials, and disciplinings for their purification. Eventually, in <a href=Num.htm#v32>ch. 32</a> and in <a href=Num.htm#v33_50>33:50</a>&mdash;<a href=Num.htm#v36_13>36:13</a> God&rsquo;s people received the prearrangement for the distribution of the promised good land. After all the foregoing, God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people were ready to cross the Jordan, enter Canaan, consume its inhabitants, and possess the good land promised by the faithful God (<a href=Jos.htm#v1_2>Josh. 1:2</a>-<a href=Jos.htm#v1_3>3</a>). With the exception of Joshua and Caleb, those who were qualified to take possession of the land were the younger ones, the second generation of those who had come out of Egypt. This younger generation had received the benefit of all that the first generation had experienced. With a rich inheritance and strong background, they were qualified to be formed into an army to fight with God and for God for the accomplishing of His economy. This history of Israel is a full type of the history of the church in its accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal economy in the mystical union with the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed and dispensing Triune God (<a href=1Co.htm#v5_6>1&nbsp;Cor. 5:6</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v5_8>8</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v10_1>10:1</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v10_13>13</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v3_7>Heb. 3:7</a>&mdash;<a href=Heb.htm#v4_13>4:13</a>).
