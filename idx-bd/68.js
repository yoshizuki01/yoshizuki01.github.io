The bear, characterized by its destroying feet, was the symbol of the monarchy of Medo-Persia. The lion, characterized by its devouring mouth, was a symbol of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. Since Antichrist, the beast, is like these three, he will have all their characteristics, as mentioned in <a href=Dan.htm#v7_4>Dan. 7:4</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v7_7>7</a>. He is the totality of all the evil powers in human history."
