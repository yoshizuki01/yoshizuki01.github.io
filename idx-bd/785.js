BD["O+*\x98"]="<b>kingdom</b><br> &emsp; In John the Baptist&rsquo;s preaching, repentance, as the opening of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, involved making a turn for the kingdom of the heavens. This indicates that God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is focused on His kingdom. For this we should repent, change our mind, make a turn in our life-pursuit. The goal of our pursuing has been other things; now our pursuing must turn toward God and His kingdom, which in Matthew (cf. <a href=Mrk.htm#v1_15>Mark 1:15</a>) is specifically and purposefully called &ldquo;the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; According to the Gospel of Matthew as a whole, the kingdom of the heavens is different from the Messianic kingdom. The Messianic kingdom will be the restored kingdom of David (the rebuilt tabernacle of David&mdash;<a href=Act.htm#v15_16>Acts 15:16</a>), made up of the children of Israel, and will be earthly and physical in nature; whereas the kingdom of the heavens is constituted of regenerated believers and is heavenly and spiritual.

God&rsquo;s announcing of the glad tidings in <a href=Gen.htm#v3_15>v. 15</a> concerning the seed of the woman destroying the serpent was the first instance of the proclaiming of the gospel in the entire Bible. After hearing the glad tidings, Adam believed that he and Eve would live and not die (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v3_14>John 3:14</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_16>16</a>); thus, he called his wife&rsquo;s name Eve, living. Hence, God was the first preacher of the glad tidings of the gospel, and Adam was the first believer."
BD["M01\x8c"]="Thus says Jehovah of hosts, Let your hands be strong, you who in these days hear these words from the mouth of the prophets who were there in the day when the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts, that is, the temple, was laid so that it might be built."

God&rsquo;s intention in creating man was to carry out His divine economy for the dispensing of Himself into man (<a href=1Ti.htm#v1_4>1&nbsp;Tim. 1:4</a> and <a href=1TiN.htm#n1_4x3P1>note 3, par. 1</a>).

However, God disciplined Moses for forty years (<a href=Act.htm#v7_30>Acts 7:30</a>) and did not call him until he had lost all confidence in himself (cf. <a href=Exo.htm#v4_10>4:10</a> and <a href=ExoN.htm#n4_10x1>note</a>).

This indicates that eventually Christ&rsquo;s life and our individual Christian life issue in a totality&mdash;the church life as a corporate meal offering. Such a life is a life of humanity mingled with the Holy Spirit and which has the Holy Spirit poured upon it, a life with salt and frankincense but with no leaven or honey (see notes <a href=LevN.htm#n2_1x4>1<sup>4</sup></a>, <a href=LevN.htm#n2_11x1>11<sup>1</sup></a>, <a href=LevN.htm#n2_11x2>11<sup>2</sup></a>, and <a href=LevN.htm#n2_13x1>13<sup>1</sup></a>).
