The mystery of the faith is mainly Christ as the mystery of God (<a href=Col.htm#v2_2>Col. 2:2</a>) and the church as the mystery of Christ (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_4>Eph. 3:4</a>). A deacon in a local church should hold the mystery of the faith with full understanding in a pure conscience for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony."
BD["]+0\x9a"]="<b>not</b><br> &emsp; A deacon should not seek gain from his rendering of service to the saints. To seek such gain is to be greedy for base gain (cf. <a href=1Ti.htm#v6_5>6:5b</a>)."

For a woman to teach in this way or to exercise authority over a man is to leave her position. In God&rsquo;s creation man was ordained to be the head, and woman to be in subjection to man (<a href=1Co.htm#v11_3>1&nbsp;Cor. 11:3</a>). In the church this ordination should be kept."

BD["U7U\x97"]="<b>soul</b><br> &emsp; Through creation Adam became a living soul with a soulish body. Through resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit with a spiritual body. Adam as a living soul is natural; Christ as a life-giving Spirit is resurrected. First, in incarnation He became flesh for redemption (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>29</a>); then, in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for the imparting of life (<a href=Joh.htm#v10_10>John 10:10b</a>). Through incarnation He had a soulish body, as Adam had; through resurrection He has a spiritual body. His soulish body has become a spiritual one through resurrection. Now He is a life-giving Spirit in resurrection, with a spiritual body, ready to be received by His believers. When we believe into Him, He enters our spirit, and we are joined to Him as the life-giving Spirit. Hence, we become one spirit with Him (<a href=1Co.htm#v6_17>6:17</a>). Our spirit is made alive and is resurrected with Him. Eventually, our present soulish body will become a spiritual body in resurrection, just like His (vv. <a href=1Co.htm#v15_52>52</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v15_54>54</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v3_21>Phil. 3:21</a>)."
