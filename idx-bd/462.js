Just as Ruth had the right to enjoy the produce of the good land after coming into the land, so we have the right to enjoy Christ as our good land after believing in Him. Ruth&rsquo;s exercising of her right to gain and possess the produce of the good land signifies that, after believing into Christ and being organically joined to Him, we must begin to pursue Christ in order to gain, possess, experience, and enjoy Him (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_7>Phil. 3:7</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_16>16</a>).<br> &emsp; This book portrays the way, the position, the qualification, and the right of sinners to participate in Christ and to enjoy Christ. According to God&rsquo;s ordination we who have believed into Christ have been qualified and positioned to claim our right to enjoy Christ (<a href=Col.htm#v1_12>Col. 1:12</a>). This means that we do not need to beg God to save us; rather, we can go to God to claim His salvation for ourselves.

BD["--4\x97"]="<b>manna</b><br> &emsp; The ceasing of the manna when the people began to eat the produce of the land indicates that the produce of the land was the continuation of the manna. The manna eaten by Israel in their wandering in the wilderness (<a href=Exo.htm#v16>Exo. 16</a>) typifies Christ as the heavenly food given directly by God to His chosen people, which requires no labor on the part of the eaters. The rich produce of the promised land given by God to Israel in their fighting in Canaan (<a href=Deu.htm#v8_7>Deut. 8:7</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v8_10>10</a>) typifies Christ as the consummated life supply (the life-giving Spirit&mdash;<a href=Gal.htm#v3_14>Gal. 3:14</a>) given to the believers, which requires them to labor on Him. As portrayed in the typology here, after possessing Christ as the land, we need to labor on Him to produce something of Him that will become our food, our supply. As we eat Christ and enjoy Him as the produce of the good land, we are constituted with Him, being made the same as Christ in life, nature, and expression (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_19>Phil. 1:19</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>21a</a>). Ultimately, our enjoying of Christ as our inheritance, our possession, will constitute us to be God&rsquo;s inheritance, God&rsquo;s treasure and possession (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_11>Eph. 1:11</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_14>14</a>, <a href=Eph.htm#v1_18>18b</a>; cf. <a href=Exo.htm#v19_5>Exo. 19:5</a>).<br> &emsp; In Egypt, by their eating Egyptian food (signifying worldly things), the children of Israel were constituted to be a worldly people. In their experience of God&rsquo;s salvation Israel passed through three stages in their eating. In the first stage they ate the passover lamb in Egypt (<a href=Exo.htm#v12>Exo. 12</a>), which strengthened them to walk out of Egypt and to be separated from the Egyptian world. In the second stage they ate the manna in the wilderness (<a href=Exo.htm#v16>Exo. 16</a>), which reconstituted them with a heavenly element to be a heavenly people. In the third stage they ate the rich produce in the good land, which constituted them further to be an overcoming people. By enjoying the riches of the good land, Israel conquered the tribes in the land, established the kingdom of God, and built up the temple as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. The three stages in Israel&rsquo;s eating typify the three stages of the believers&rsquo; enjoyment of Christ by eating Him (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_51>John 6:51</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v6_57>57</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v5_7>1&nbsp;Cor. 5:7</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v5_8>8</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v10_3>10:3</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v10_4>4</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v1_19>Phil. 1:19</a>). By their eating in the first two stages the believers are energized to leave the world and are constituted with Christ as the heavenly element. To reach the goal of God&rsquo;s economy, all Christ&rsquo;s believers need to progress until they enter into the highest stage of eating Christ as the rich produce of the good land, the all-inclusive Spirit, that they may overcome the spiritual enemies, be built up to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place, and establish God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth."

BD[")94\x97"]="<b>heavy</b><br> &emsp; As the one praying on the mountaintop, Moses typifies Christ, but as the one whose hands became heavy, Moses represents us. This signifies that while Christ is praying in the heavens, we too need to pray on earth (<a href=1Ti.htm#v2_8>1&nbsp;Tim. 2:8</a>). Because the flesh never changes or improves, in order to prevail against the flesh, we need to pray without ceasing (<a href=1Th.htm#v5_17>1&nbsp;Thes. 5:17</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v4_2>Col. 4:2</a>), joining ourselves to Christ in His intercession. However, often our praying hands become heavy. Thus, we need a stone to support us, and we need the help of Aaron and Hur. The stone, a solid base for our prayer life, refers to our realization that in ourselves we are weak and that in order to sustain our prayer, we need Christ to be our support (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v15_5>John 15:5b</a>). Aaron, the high priest (<a href=Exo.htm#v28_1>28:1</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v5_1>Heb. 5:1</a>, <a href=Heb.htm#v5_4>4</a>), signifies the priesthood, and Hur, who was of the tribe of Judah (<a href=Exo.htm#v31_2>31:2</a>), signifies the kingship (<a href=Gen.htm#v49_10>Gen. 49:10</a>). The priesthood is related to the Holy of Holies, which in our experience is always related to our spirit (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_19>Heb. 10:19</a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n10_19x1>note</a>). Hence, to sustain our prayer and to thus defeat the flesh, we need the priesthood to strengthen our spirit. We also need to be obedient to the Lord under His authority, the kingship. Furthermore, Hur is related to the building of the tabernacle (<a href=Exo.htm#v31_2>31:2</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v31_5>5</a>), and the direction of Exodus is toward this goal. This indicates that we need to take the building of the church as the goal of our prayer."

According to God&rsquo;s economy, Christ should be the unique diet, the only food, strength, satisfaction, and sustenance, of God&rsquo;s chosen people, and they should live by Him alone (<a href=Num.htm#v11_6>Num. 11:6</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v6_57>John 6:57</a>). In order to be food to us, Christ was incarnated, crucified, and resurrected to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit to indwell our spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_63>John 6:63</a> and <a href=JohN.htm#n6_63x1>notes</a>).<br> &emsp; Although it is known that manna came from heaven (<a href=Exo.htm#v16_4>v. 4</a>), the element and essence of manna are a mystery. Manna did not belong to the old creation; nevertheless, it could nourish man&rsquo;s physical body. Thus, it must have contained certain elements and minerals that were a part of the old creation. As the real manna, Christ also is mysterious. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>), yet He has a body that can be seen and touched (<a href=Luk.htm#v24_36>Luke 24:36</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v24_43>43</a>).

To take the tree of knowledge is actually to marry Satan and divorce God. Since the beginning of man&rsquo;s existence man has been forsaking God and joining to Satan, taking many things as replacements of God (idols). This forsaking of God and joining to Satan, portrayed here by Israel&rsquo;s forsaking Jehovah and joining themselves to idols, is the strongest factor behind the chaos in human society, including that in Israel.
