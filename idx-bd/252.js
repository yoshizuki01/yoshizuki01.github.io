BD["(*1\x98"]="<b>tree</b><br> &emsp; The second step of God&rsquo;s procedure in fulfilling His purpose was to place the created man in front of the tree of life, which signifies the Triune God embodied in Christ as life to man in the form of food. God&rsquo;s placing man in front of the tree of life indicates that God wanted man to receive Him as man&rsquo;s life by eating Him organically and assimilating Him metabolically, that God might become the very constituent of man&rsquo;s being. According to <a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>John 1:1</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_4>4</a>, life is in the Word, who is God Himself. This life&mdash;the divine, eternal, uncreated life of God&mdash;is Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v11_25>John 11:25</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v14_6>14:6</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v3_4>Col. 3:4a</a>), who is the embodiment of God (<a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>). The tree of life grows along the two sides of the river of water of life (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>Rev. 22:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v22_2>2</a>), indicating that it is a vine. Since Christ is a vine tree (<a href=Joh.htm#v15_1>John 15:1</a>) and is also life, He is the tree of life. He was processed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection that man might have life and live by eating Him (<a href=Joh.htm#v10_10>John 10:10b</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v6_51>6:51</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v6_57>57</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v6_63>63</a>)."
