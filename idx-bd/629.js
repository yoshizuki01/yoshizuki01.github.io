God&rsquo;s people had fallen into a worldly life under Pharaoh&rsquo;s usurpation. God&rsquo;s desire is that His people would be His dwelling place on earth; however, this desire cannot be fulfilled unless His people are delivered from the world and separated to Him. God&rsquo;s purpose in the twelve conflicts with Pharaoh was to execute His judgment on the world and its ruler, and to expose to His people the nature, meaning, and result of life in the world under Pharaoh&rsquo;s usurpation, so that they would hate that life (cf. <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_15>1&nbsp;John 2:15</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_17>17</a>), flee from it, and be gathered to the Lord at the mountain of God to receive the revelation concerning God and His dwelling place (<a href=Exo.htm#v19_1>19:1</a>&mdash;<a href=Exo.htm#v34_35>34:35</a>)."

BD["ALE\x8c"]="And I will save you from all your uncleanness, and I will summon the grain and multiply it, and bring no famine upon you."

BD["(+7\x9a"]="<b>bruise</b><br> &emsp; The bruising of the serpent&rsquo;s head by the seed of the woman is the destroying of Satan, the one who has the might of death, by the Lord Jesus through His death on the cross (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_14>Heb. 2:14</a> and <a href=HebN.htm#n2_14x1>note</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v3_8>1&nbsp;John 3:8</a>). While the Lord was destroying the serpent on the cross, the serpent bruised His heel, i.e., wounded Him by nailing His feet to the cross (<a href=Psa.htm#v22_16>Psa. 22:16</a>).<br> &emsp; Through the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross, Satan, the old serpent, was judged, cast out (<a href=Joh.htm#v12_31>John 12:31</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v16_11>16:11</a>). That judgment will ultimately be carried out by the overcomers as the man-child, the corporate seed of the woman (<a href=Rev.htm#v12_9>Rev. 12:9</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n12_9x1>note 1</a>)."

BD["**)\x97"]="<b>meal</b><br> &emsp; The meal offering typifies Christ in His human living. The emphasis of the burnt offering (<a href=Lev.htm#v1>ch. 1</a>) is on Christ&rsquo;s living for God, being obedient to God even unto death (<a href=Phi.htm#v2_8>Phil. 2:8</a>), implying His living but emphasizing His death. The emphasis of the meal offering is on Christ&rsquo;s human living and daily walk, implying His death but emphasizing His living (see <a href=LevN.htm#n2_13x1>note 13<sup>1</sup></a>). The burnt offering emphasizes that Christ is the righteousness of God (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>; cf. <a href=2Co.htm#v5_21>2&nbsp;Cor. 5:21</a>), whereas the meal offering emphasizes that Christ is righteous before God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_1>1&nbsp;John 2:1</a>)."

By laying our hands on Christ as our offering, we are joined to Him, and He and we become one. In such a union all our weaknesses, defects, and faults are taken on by Him, and all His virtues become ours. This requires us to exercise our spirit through the proper prayer so that we may be one with Him in an experiential way (cf. <a href=1Co.htm#v6_17>1&nbsp;Cor. 6:17</a> and <a href=1CoN.htm#n6_17x1>notes</a>). When we lay our hands on Christ through prayer, the life-giving Spirit, who is the very Christ on whom we lay our hands (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_6>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:6</a>, <a href=2Co.htm#v3_17>17</a>), will immediately move and work within us to live in us a life that is a repetition of the life that Christ lived on earth, the life of the burnt offering."
