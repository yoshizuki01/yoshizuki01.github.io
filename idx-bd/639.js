BD["i.4\x97"]="<b>sixth</b><br> &emsp; The sixth seal, which marks the beginning of supernatural calamities, is God&rsquo;s answer to the cry of the martyred saints in the fifth seal and is a warning to those who dwell on the earth. According to <a href=Joe.htm#v2_30>Joel 2:30</a>-<a href=Joe.htm#v2_31>31</a>, there will not be much difference in time between the sixth seal and the first five trumpets (<a href=Rev.htm#v9_1>9:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v9_11>11</a>). <a href=Joe.htm#v2_30>Joel 2:30</a>-<a href=Joe.htm#v2_31>31</a> first mentions the blood of the first and second trumpets, the fire of the first, second, and third trumpets (<a href=Rev.htm#v8_7>8:7</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v8_10>10</a>), and the smoke of the fifth trumpet (<a href=Rev.htm#v9_1>9:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v9_3>3</a>), and then mentions the sun and moon of the sixth seal. A comparison of <a href=Rev.htm#v9_4>9:4</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v7_3>7:3</a> indicates that the fifth trumpet occurs very close to the time of the sixth seal."

BD["i*\@\x97"]="<b>deep</b><br> &emsp; In Greek the word for deep things means depths, as in <a href=Eph.htm#v3_18>Eph. 3:18</a>. It is used figuratively here and denotes mysterious things. The Roman Catholic Church has many mysteries or deep doctrines. The synagogue of Satan (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_9>v. 9</a>) was against the suffering church; the throne of Satan (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_13>v. 13</a>) was with the worldly church; and the deep things of Satan are within the apostate church. The religion of the synagogue, the world under Satan&rsquo;s throne, and the philosophy of the satanic mysteries are all used by Satan to damage and corrupt the church."
