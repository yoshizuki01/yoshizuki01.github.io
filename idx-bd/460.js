The four horns are the four kingdoms with their kings&mdash;Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire&mdash;also signified by the great human image in <a href=Dan.htm#v2_31>Dan. 2:31</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v2_33>33</a> and by the four beasts in <a href=Dan.htm#v7_3>Dan. 7:3</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v7_8>8</a>, that damaged and destroyed the chosen people of God. The four craftsmen (<a href=Zec.htm#v1_20>v. 20</a>) are the skills used by God to destroy these four kingdoms with their kings. Each of the first three kingdoms&mdash;Babylon, Medo-Persia, and Greece&mdash;was taken over in a skillful way by the kingdom that followed it (cf. <a href=Dan.htm#v5>Dan. 5</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v8_3>8:3</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v8_7>7</a>). The fourth Craftsman will be Christ as the stone cut out without hands, who will crush the restored Roman Empire and thereby crush the great human image as the totality of human government at His coming back (<a href=Dan.htm#v2_31>Dan. 2:31</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v2_35>35</a>)."
