BD["a).\x97"]="<b>Firstborn</b><br> &emsp; This verse refers to the Son&rsquo;s second coming. In His first coming He was God&rsquo;s only begotten Son (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>). Through the process of resurrection the only begotten Son became the Firstborn among many brothers (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>Rom. 8:29</a>). Thus, in His second coming He will be the Firstborn."
BD[":0*\x99"]="<b>adversaries</b><br> &emsp; Signifying Satan, who is God&rsquo;s adversary within God&rsquo;s kingdom, God&rsquo;s enemy outside God&rsquo;s kingdom, and the avenger who roves to and fro over the earth (cf. <a href=Job.htm#v1_7>Job 1:7</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v5_8>1&nbsp;Pet. 5:8</a>). Above the heavens is God&rsquo;s splendor, and on the earth is the excellent name of Jesus; but between the earth and heavens are the adversary, the enemy, and the avenger (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_2>Eph. 2:2</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v6_12>6:12</a>). The Lord stops these three categories of negative ones by establishing strength and perfecting praise out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, the youngest, smallest, and weakest ones. In this psalm the perfected praise includes the praise for the Lord&rsquo;s glory above the heavens, His excellency on the earth (<a href=Psa.htm#v8_1>v. 1</a>), and His incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, and coming kingdom (vv. <a href=Psa.htm#v8_4>4</a>-<a href=Psa.htm#v8_8>8</a>). To praise the Lord in such a perfected way requires strength. The highest consummation of the Lord&rsquo;s work in His redemption is to strengthen the weakest and smallest ones and perfect the praise they offer to Him out of their mouths."
