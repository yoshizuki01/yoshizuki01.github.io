BD["7*+\x97"]="<b>May</b><br> &emsp; Being an aggressive person, Nehemiah took advantage of this opportunity to speak to the king. Although he was a common man, a servant of the king, he was aggressive to volunteer himself to God for his burden concerning the building up of Jerusalem. He was also aggressive in making his requests known to the king (vv. <a href=Neh.htm#v2_4>4</a>-<a href=Neh.htm#v2_8>8</a>). His aggressiveness was very much used by God. In type, Nehemiah&rsquo;s aggressiveness, as a virtue in his human conduct, shows that our natural capacity, natural ability, and natural virtues must pass through the cross of Christ and be brought into resurrection, i.e., into the Spirit as the consummated Triune God (<a href=Joh.htm#v11_25>John 11:25</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>), to be useful to God in the accomplishing of His economy.<br> &emsp; Nehemiah was one who lived not in his natural man but in resurrection. He was aggressive, but his aggressiveness was accompanied by other characteristics. In His relationship with God, He was one who loved God and also loved God&rsquo;s interests on the earth, including the Holy Land (signifying Christ), the holy temple (signifying the church), and the holy city (signifying the kingdom of God). As a person who loved God, Nehemiah prayed to God to contact Him in fellowship (<a href=Neh.htm#v1_4>1:4</a>; <a href=Neh.htm#v2_4>2:4b</a>; <a href=Neh.htm#v4_4>4:4</a>-<a href=Neh.htm#v4_5>5</a>, <a href=Neh.htm#v4_9>9</a>). Furthermore, Nehemiah trusted in God and even became one with God. As a result, he became the representative of God. In his relationship with the people, Nehemiah was altogether unselfish; with him, there was no self-seeking or self-interest. He was always willing to sacrifice what he had for the people and for the nation (<a href=Neh.htm#v5_10>5:10</a>, <a href=Neh.htm#v5_14>14</a>-<a href=Neh.htm#v5_19>19</a>).

This indicates that, in type, it was outside the death of Christ. Our self-choice is likewise outside the death of Christ and therefore has nothing to do with the real enjoyment of the rich Christ. If we do not pass through the death of Christ, we cannot enter into the realm of His resurrection and ascension to enjoy Him as the heavenly, elevated One (cf. <a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v3_10>Phil. 3:10</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v3_11>11</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v3_1>Col. 3:1</a>-<a href=Col.htm#v3_4>4</a>)."
