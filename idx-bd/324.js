The salvation mentioned in this verse and referred to in <a href=Heb.htm#v2_3>v. 3</a> and <a href=Heb.htm#v1_14>1:14</a> saves us from our fallen state into glory. Jesus, as the Pioneer, the Forerunner (<a href=Heb.htm#v6_20>6:20</a>), took the lead to enter into glory, and we, His followers, are taking the same way to be brought into the same glory, which was ordained by God for us (<a href=1Co.htm#v2_7>1&nbsp;Cor. 2:7</a>; <a href=1Th.htm#v2_12>1&nbsp;Thes. 2:12</a>). He cut the way, and we are now taking the way. Hence, He is not only the Savior who saved us from our fallen state but also the Author who, as the Pioneer, entered into glory that we may be brought into the same estate."

BD["a)6\x97"]="<b>those</b><br> &emsp; The Son is the appointed Heir of all things (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_2>v. 2</a>). We, His believers, are His partners (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_9>v. 9</a>). Thus, we are His joint heirs (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_17>Rom. 8:17</a>), not only inheriting salvation but also inheriting all things with Him (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_21>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:21</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_22>22</a>). Hence, we with Him are joint owners of the universe, while the angels are merely our servants, inferior not only to Him but also to us.<br> &emsp; The Son was appointed to be the Heir. We are saved to be His joint heirs, sharing in His inheritance. The &ldquo;so great a salvation&rdquo; mentioned in <a href=Heb.htm#v2_3>2:3</a> is able to save us to such an extent that it brings us into partnership with Him in His appointment. Thus we share in whatever He inherits.<br> &emsp; As the partners of the Son, we are the house of God, the real Bethel, the gate of heaven, where the Son is the heavenly ladder, joining earth to heaven and bringing heaven to earth. On this ladder the angels of God are ascending and descending (<a href=Gen.htm#v28_12>Gen. 28:12</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v28_16>16</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v28_19>19</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_51>John 1:51</a>) as the ministering spirits to serve us, those who inherit so great a salvation. What is spoken of in this book is like the gate of heaven. Here we enjoy Christ as the heavenly One who joins us to heaven and brings heaven to us that we may be a heavenly people, living a heavenly life on earth and inheriting all the heavenly things. How could the Hebrew believers withdraw from this and return to their old religion and boast in the angels? The angels are simply our ministering servants."

In Jerusalem there were numerous synagogues for different groups of Jews (<a href=Act.htm#v6_9>Acts 6:9</a>). James&rsquo;s use of this word here may indicate that the Jewish believers considered their assembly and assembling place as another of the synagogues among the Jews. If so, this bears, as does the whole Epistle, a Jewish character and may indicate that the Jewish Christians regarded themselves as still a part of the Jewish people, the chosen people of God according to the Old Testament, and that they lacked a clear vision concerning the distinction between God&rsquo;s chosen people of the Old Testament and the believers in Christ of the New Testament.

Though not encompassed with weakness like the high priest taken from among men, Christ as our High Priest was tempted in all respects like us.
