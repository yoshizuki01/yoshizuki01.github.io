Although Assyria, not Babylon, was the first nation to trouble God in His economy (<a href=Jer.htm#v50_17>Jer. 50:17</a>), in the sight of God all the nations, including Assyria, are a part of Babylon, which was considered by God to be the head of the great human image in <a href=Dan.htm#v2_32>Dan. 2:32</a>, <a href=Dan.htm#v2_37>37</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v2_38>38</a>."

Psalms <a href=Psa.htm#v25>25</a>&mdash;<a href=Psa.htm#v41>41</a> show the mixed expressions of the psalmist&rsquo;s sentiments in his enjoyment of God in God&rsquo;s house. The enjoyment of Christ, as portrayed in <a href=Psa.htm#v2>Psa. 2</a>, <a href=Psa.htm#v8>8</a>, <a href=Psa.htm#v16>16</a>, and <a href=Psa.htm#v22>22</a>&mdash;<a href=Psa.htm#v24>24</a>, led the psalmist to another state of enjoyment&mdash;the enjoyment of God in the house of God. Although God is universal and omnipresent, He has located Himself in His house so that men may contact Him and enjoy Him (<a href=Psa.htm#v23_6>23:6</a>; <a href=Psa.htm#v27_4>27:4</a>). In the Old Testament time God&rsquo;s house, His dwelling place, was both in the heavens (<a href=1Ki.htm#v8_30>1&nbsp;Kings 8:30b</a>, <a href=1Ki.htm#v8_39>39a</a>, <a href=1Ki.htm#v8_43>43a</a>) and in the temple on Mount Zion (<a href=Psa.htm#v76_2>Psa. 76:2b</a>; <a href=Psa.htm#v135_21>135:21</a>; <a href=Isa.htm#v8_18>Isa. 8:18</a>). God&rsquo;s physical house in the Old Testament is a type of His spiritual house in the New Testament (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_5>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5</a>). God&rsquo;s house in the New Testament is, first, Christ as God&rsquo;s tabernacle and God&rsquo;s temple (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v2_21>2:21</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>); second, it is the church, the enlargement of Christ, as God&rsquo;s enlarged temple (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_16>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:16</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_21>Eph. 2:21</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>22</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v3_6>Heb. 3:6</a>). Consummately, God&rsquo;s house will be the New Jerusalem, a composition of God&rsquo;s redeemed as the tabernacle (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_2>Rev. 21:2</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_3>3</a>) for God to dwell in and enjoy His redeemed, and the redeeming God Himself as the temple (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_22>Rev. 21:22</a>) for His redeemed to dwell in and enjoy Him&mdash;a mutual dwelling of both God and man for their mutual enjoyment. We enjoy God in His house by being in Christ and in the church in this age, and ultimately in the New Jerusalem in the next age and in eternity."

It also concerns human government from Nimrod to Antichrist. Because Israel and human government are for Christ, this book also reveals certain aspects of Christ, who is the center and the circumference, the centrality and the universality, of God&rsquo;s move. In particular, it reveals Christ&rsquo;s death (<a href=Dan.htm#v9_25>9:25</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v9_26>26</a>), His appearing in His second coming (<a href=Dan.htm#v2_34>2:34</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v2_35>35</a>, <a href=Dan.htm#v2_45>45</a>), His receiving dominion and a kingdom (<a href=Dan.htm#v7_13>7:13</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v7_14>14</a>), His being the companion of the suffering witnesses of God (<a href=Dan.htm#v3_23>3:23</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v3_25>25</a>), and His excellency (<a href=Dan.htm#v10_4>10:4</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v10_9>9</a>).<br> &emsp; The central thought of Daniel is that the ruling of the heavens (<a href=Dan.htm#v4_26>4:26</a>), i.e., of the God of the heavens (<a href=Dan.htm#v2_37>2:37</a>, <a href=Dan.htm#v2_44>44</a>), over all human government on earth matches God&rsquo;s eternal economy so that Christ would terminate the old creation for the germination of the new creation and would smash and crush the aggregate of human government and establish the eternal kingdom of God."
