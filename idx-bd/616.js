Thus, the promise here indicates that God Himself would come to be a human seed to bruise the head of the damaging serpent. Ultimately, the seed of the woman is enlarged to include the overcoming believers, the stronger part of God&rsquo;s people, signified by the man-child in <a href=Rev.htm#v12_5>Rev. 12:5</a> (see <a href=RevN.htm#n12_5x2>note 2</a> there).

The Lord as the leading Overcomer (<a href=Rev.htm#v3_21>Rev. 3:21</a>) is the Head, center, reality, life, and nature of the man-child, and the man-child as the following overcomers is the Lord&rsquo;s Body."

BD["?Z)\x97"]="<b>Babylon</b><br> &emsp; The origin and initiation of Babylon was Babel (<a href=Gen.htm#v11_7>Gen. 11:7</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v11_9>9</a>). Babel was built by Nimrod, a descendant of Ham, and was the beginning of human government on earth formed in opposition to God (<a href=Gen.htm#v10_6>Gen. 10:6</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v10_11>11</a>; <a href=Dan.htm#v2_31>Dan. 2:31</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v2_32>32</a>, <a href=Dan.htm#v2_38>38</a>). It was a land full of idols, where man worshipped idols, exalted man&rsquo;s self, and opposed God (<a href=Jer.htm#v50_38>v. 38b</a>; <a href=Jos.htm#v24_2>Josh. 24:2</a>; <a href=Gen.htm#v11_3>Gen. 11:3</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v11_4>4</a>). Babel had its continuation in Babylon, which, in the sight of God, is the consummation of human government. Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, was even identified with Satan as Satan&rsquo;s embodiment (<a href=Isa.htm#v14_4>Isa. 14:4</a>, <a href=Isa.htm#v14_11>11</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v14_15>15</a>). It was this Babylon that destroyed God&rsquo;s holy city and His holy temple and carried God&rsquo;s holy people and the vessels of God&rsquo;s temple into captivity (<a href=2Ch.htm#v36_17>2&nbsp;Chron. 36:17</a>-<a href=2Ch.htm#v36_20>20</a>). The coming restored Roman Empire under Antichrist, and the Roman Church, will both, in the spiritual sense, be called Babylon the Great (<a href=Rev.htm#v17_5>Rev. 17:5</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v18_2>18:2</a>). Hence, Babylon typifies the world, both physically and spiritually, that worships idols, exalts man, and rebels against God to the uttermost, all of which was or will be utterly destroyed by God (<a href=Jer.htm#v51_11>51:11</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v14_8>Rev. 14:8</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v16_19>16:19b</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v17_16>17:16</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v18_8>18:8</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v18_10>10</a>).<br> &emsp; God will judge Babylon to such an extent that nothing of Babylon will remain in the universe. Both Isaiah and Jeremiah prophesied that once Babylon has been destroyed, it will not be restored (<a href=Isa.htm#v14_22>Isa. 14:22</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v14_23>23</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v50_39>Jer. 50:39</a>; <a href=Jer.htm#v51_62>51:62</a>). When God destroys both the religious and the political Babylon at the end of the age, that will be the end of the judgment on Babylon prophesied in chs. <a href=Jer.htm#v50>50</a>&mdash;<a href=Jer.htm#v51>51</a>. After this, there will be no more human government on earth. See <a href=Dan.htm#v2_32>Dan. 2:32</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v2_34>34</a> and <a href=DanN.htm#n2_32x1>notes</a>."

The entire chapter is a confession that will be made by the household of Israel who will be saved at Christ&rsquo;s second coming (<a href=Zec.htm#v12_10>Zech. 12:10</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v11_26>Rom. 11:26</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v11_27>27</a>).
