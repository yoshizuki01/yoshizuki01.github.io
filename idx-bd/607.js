God is not only loving and merciful, but He is also just and fearsome. On the one hand, God forgave David (<a href=2Sa.htm#v12_13>v. 13</a>), but on the other hand, He disciplined and chastised David according to His governmental righteousness (vv. <a href=2Sa.htm#v12_10>10</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v12_14>14</a>). God exercised a severe punishment upon David because his sin was very evil. After David&rsquo;s failure many evils, including incest, murder, and rebellion, took place in his family (<a href=2Sa.htm#v13>ch. 13</a>; <a href=2Sa.htm#v15_1>15:1</a>&mdash;<a href=2Sa.htm#v19_8>19:8a</a>). The source of the unprecedented evil in David&rsquo;s family was David&rsquo;s indulgence in the lust of the flesh. This shows that God&rsquo;s chastisement and His governmental dealing with those who love Him may even affect their children.<br> &emsp; David, being a man according to God&rsquo;s heart, afforded God the way to begin the age of the kingship for the establishing of God&rsquo;s kingdom on the earth for His coming Christ. How regrettable it was that David, at a crucial time of the evil one&rsquo;s temptation, did not exercise strong control over his lust but indulged in it and committed a gross sin that offended God to the uttermost. God loved David, but because of his sin David lost his standing and position as well as eleven of the twelve tribes (<a href=2Sa.htm#v20_1>20:1</a>-<a href=2Sa.htm#v20_2>2</a>). David&rsquo;s sin sowed the seed of Solomon&rsquo;s corruption (see <a href=2SaN.htm#n12_24x1>note 24<sup>1</sup></a>), which issued in the dividing of the God-given kingdom (<a href=1Ki.htm#v11_9>1&nbsp;Kings 11:9</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v11_13>13</a>; <a href=1Ki.htm#v12_1>12:1</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v12_17>17</a>), and the seed of the corruption of Solomon&rsquo;s descendants in the kingship, which issued ultimately in the loss of the nation and of the holy land of their fathers, in the captivity of the holy people, and in their being scattered around the globe and having no peace up to the present time."

BD["2/8\x97"]="<b>capitals</b><br> &emsp; The two bronze capitals covered the tops of the pillars. The total height of each capital was five cubits (<a href=1Ki.htm#v7_16>v. 16</a>; <a href=2Ch.htm#v3_15>2&nbsp;Chron. 3:15</a>), divided between the base (three cubits&mdash;<a href=2Ki.htm#v25_17>2&nbsp;Kings 25:17</a>) and the two bowls on top of each capital (<a href=2Ch.htm#v4_12>2&nbsp;Chron. 4:12</a>). The number three here signifies the process of resurrection; the number two, a testimony (<a href=Deu.htm#v17_6>Deut. 17:6</a>); the number five, the bearing of responsibility (see <a href=MatN.htm#n25_2x1>note 2<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v25>Matt. 25</a>); and the number ten (the combined height of the two capitals), fullness in bearing responsibility. The bowls were the glory, beauty, decoration, and crown of the capitals. They were covered with nets of checker work (like a trellis) and wreaths of chain work (<a href=1Ki.htm#v7_17>v. 17</a>). These signify the complicated and intermixed situation in which those who are pillars in God&rsquo;s building (<a href=Gal.htm#v2_9>Gal. 2:9</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v3_12>Rev. 3:12</a>) live and bear responsibility. Lilies were on the nets (<a href=1Ki.htm#v7_19>v. 19</a>), and two rows of one hundred pomegranates were on the wreaths (<a href=1Ki.htm#v7_18>v. 18</a>; <a href=2Ki.htm#v25_17>2&nbsp;Kings 25:17</a>; <a href=2Ch.htm#v3_16>2&nbsp;Chron. 3:16</a>; <a href=2Ch.htm#v4_13>4:13</a>). Lilies signify a life of faith in God (<a href=SoS.htm#v2_1>S.S. 2:1</a>-<a href=SoS.htm#v2_2>2</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v6_28>Matt. 6:28</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v6_30>30</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v2_20>Gal. 2:20</a>), and pomegranates, having many seeds, signify the expression of the riches of the divine life. A life of faith that expresses the riches of the divine life is the issue of the experience of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion in and through the complicated and intermixed situation (cf. <a href=2Co.htm#v4_7>2&nbsp;Cor. 4:7</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v4_18>18</a>). In spiritual significance the bowls of the capitals are a testimony (two) indicating that those who place themselves under God&rsquo;s judgment (bronze), counting themselves as nothing, are able to bear responsibility (five) in full (ten) and express the riches of the divine life (pomegranates) in the midst of a complicated and intermixed situation (the checker work and chain work) out of the process of resurrection (the base of the capitals, three cubits in height) because they do not live by themselves but by God (lilies). A believer who is a pillar as a sign of God&rsquo;s building must bear the testimony of living by faith to bear responsibility and express the riches of life through the process of resurrection under the crossing out of the checker work and the restriction of the chain work.<br> &emsp; For additional details concerning the two bronze pillars and their capitals in relation to spiritual experience, see Life-study of Genesis, Messages Eighty-three and Eighty-four."
