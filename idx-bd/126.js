Such a life differs from the outward gifts listed in <a href=1Co.htm#v12>ch. 12</a>. The Corinthians were pursuing the outward gifts, but they neglected love, the expression of God&rsquo;s life.

This Body, having been regenerated and being saturated with the Spirit as its essence, has the hope of being transfigured into the full likeness of Christ. The next three form the second group, that of the Lord with faith and baptism that we may be joined to Him. The last of the seven forms the third group, the one God and Father, who is the Originator and source of all. The Spirit as the Executor of the Body, the Son as the Creator of the Body, and God the Father as the Originator of the Body&mdash;all the three of the Triune God&mdash;are related to the Body. The Third of the Trinity is the first mentioned in vv. <a href=Eph.htm#v4_4>4</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v4_6>6</a> because the main concern here is the Body, of which the Spirit is the essence and the life and life supply.
