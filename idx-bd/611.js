The implication here is that while we are pursuing peace with all men, we must pay attention to the matter of sanctification before God. Our pursuing of peace with all men must be balanced by our sanctification before God, our being separated unto God, without which no one will see the Lord and have fellowship with Him."

There Christ as the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world, which came into the world through Adam (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_12>Rom. 5:12</a>). Here He takes away sins, which are committed by all men. <a href=Joh.htm#v1>John 1</a> deals with the totality of sin, including the sinful nature and sinful deeds. This chapter deals only with the fruits of sin, that is, the sins committed in man&rsquo;s daily life. Both are taken away by Christ."

The people of Israel had been damaged by Satan and carried away into captivity; as a result, the heavens could not be opened to them. However, among those in captivity there was a priest, Ezekiel (<a href=Ezk.htm#v1_3>v. 3</a>), who was seeking God and contacting Him and who was connected to the heavens. The heavens could therefore be opened to him and could even come down to the earth, enabling God&rsquo;s heavenly things to be seen by people on earth and to be fulfilled among them on earth."

BD["d);\x9a"]="<b>day</b><br> &emsp; A metaphor illustrating a coming time that will be full of light, as a bright day dawning, with the morning star rising, before its dawning, in the hearts of the believers, who are illuminated and enlightened by giving heed to the shining word of prophecy in the Scripture. In the time of apostasy the believers do well to give heed in this matter, that the prophetic word, as a lamp, may shine through the darkness of apostasy until such a day dawns upon them. This will cause and encourage them to earnestly seek the Lord&rsquo;s presence and be watchful so that they will not miss the Lord in the secret part of His coming (parousia), when He will come as a thief (see notes <a href=MatN.htm#n24_27x1>27<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v24>Matt. 24</a> and <a href=2ThN.htm#n2_8x3>8<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=2Th.htm#v2>2&nbsp;Thes. 2</a>). Hence, this metaphor must allude to the coming age, the age of the kingdom, as a day that will dawn at the appearing (the coming) of the Lord (<a href=2Pe.htm#v1_16>v. 16</a>) as the Sun of righteousness (<a href=Mal.htm#v4_2>Mal. 4:2</a>), whose light will shine to break through the gloom of the dark night of this age. Preceding this, in the darkest hour of the night the Lord will appear as the morning star (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_28>Rev. 2:28</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_16>22:16</a>) to those who are watchful and looking for His dear appearing (<a href=2Ti.htm#v4_8>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:8</a>). They have been enlightened by the shining of the prophetic word, which is able to lead them to the dawning day.<br> &emsp; If we give heed to the word in the Bible, which shines as a lamp in a dark place, we will have His rising in our hearts to shine in the darkness of apostasy where we are today, before His actual appearing as the morning star."
