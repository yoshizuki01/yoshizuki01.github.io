BD["i-.\x97"]="<b>Lamb</b><br> &emsp; In <a href=Rev.htm#v4>ch. 4</a> is the scene in the heavens, its center being the throne of God, on which God sits, ready to execute His universal administration for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. Here in <a href=Rev.htm#v5>ch. 5</a> is the same scene in the heavens after Christ ascended there. He was recommended to the apostle John as the Lion of the tribe of Judah by one of the elders, but He appeared to John as a Lamb. As the Lion, He is the Fighter against the enemy; as the Lamb, He is the Redeemer for us. He fought to redeem us, and He won the battle over the enemy and accomplished redemption for us. To the enemy He is a Lion; to us He is a Lamb. Hence, He is the Lion-Lamb."

BD["i*7\x97"]="<b>teaching</b><br> &emsp; The worldly and degraded church holds not only the teaching of Balaam but also the teaching of the Nicolaitans. The teaching of Balaam distracts believers from the person of Christ to idolatry and from the enjoyment of Christ to spiritual fornication, whereas the teaching of the Nicolaitans destroys the function of believers as members of the Body of Christ, thus annulling the Lord&rsquo;s Body as His expression. The former teaching disregards the Head, and the latter destroys the Body. This is the subtle intention of the enemy in all religious teachings.<br> &emsp; In the church in Ephesus only the works of the Nicolaitans were found (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_6>v. 6</a>), whereas in the church in Pergamos their works had progressed to become a teaching. First, the Nicolaitans practiced the hierarchy in the initial church; then they taught it in the degraded church. Today, in both Catholicism and Protestantism, this Nicolaitan hierarchy prevails in both practice and teaching."
BD["i,1\x97"]="<b>glory</b><br> &emsp; The praises of both the four living creatures in this verse and the twenty-four elders in <a href=Rev.htm#v4_11>v. 11</a> are composed of three items, implying that both the living creatures and the elders are praising the Triune God. The first two items, glory and honor, are the same in both places, but the last item is different: In the praises of the four living creatures the last item is thanks&mdash;they are redeemed and are grateful for the redemption of God&rsquo;s grace; whereas in the praises of the twenty-four elders the last item is power&mdash;as the rulers of the universe (they are not the redeemed creatures), they appreciate the power of God, by which they rule."
