BD[">>\@\x98"]="<b>bowls</b><br> &emsp; The bowls and jars typify the different ways and means for us to partake of Christ in His riches. Bowls, or cups, are small vessels to contain water, typifying the Spirit of Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v7_37>John 7:37</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v7_39>39</a>), and jars, or pitchers, are large vessels to contain wine, typifying the divine life (<a href=Mat.htm#v9_17>Matt. 9:17</a> and <a href=MatN.htm#n9_17x1>note 1</a>). This signifies that in the house of God all His children are vessels to contain His Spirit as water to quench people&rsquo;s thirst and His life as wine to cheer people unto rejoicing.

BD["F)7\x98"]="<b>As</b><br> &emsp; The principle of God&rsquo;s judgment on Edom is that as Edom has done to others, it will be done to them. The principle for judging the nations (<a href=Oba.htm#v16>v. 16</a>) is that because of the profane action of the nations in enjoying themselves upon the holy mountain of God&rsquo;s sanctuary, God would cause the other nations to drink continually at the places of those nations who participated in that profane action.
