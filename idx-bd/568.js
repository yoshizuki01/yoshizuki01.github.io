Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s economy, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. When Christ is realized through the Spirit in our spirit, we become the new creation. Hence, our spirit is vital for us to live the life of the new creation for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s purpose.<br> &emsp; This book places strong emphasis on the cross and the experience of crucifixion, in order to deal with the negative items, such as the law, the flesh, the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the religious world, slavery, and the curse, thereby bringing in the positive items that are revealed in this book: Christ, the Spirit, the sons of God, the heirs of promise, the household of the faith, the new creation, and the Israel of God. The summarizing thought in this book is that through the cross of Christ the law, the flesh, and religion are terminated that we may obtain the Spirit, the new creation, and our spirit, that through the Spirit, who is the realization of Christ, we may be the new creation in our spirit, bearing the brands of Jesus, and that we may enjoy the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ in our spirit."

BD["2/7\x97"]="<b>pillars</b><br> &emsp; The two large pillars set up by Solomon in front of the temple were a striking feature of the exterior of the temple. In the Scriptures the pillar is a sign, a testimony, of God&rsquo;s building (<a href=Gen.htm#v28_18>Gen. 28:18</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v28_19>19a</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v28_22>22a</a>; <a href=1Ki.htm#v7_15>1&nbsp;Kings 7:15</a>-<a href=1Ki.htm#v7_22>22</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v2_9>Gal. 2:9</a>; <a href=1Ti.htm#v3_15>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v3_12>Rev. 3:12</a>). That there were two pillars here (two being the number of testimony) indicates that these pillars stood as a testimony, like a signboard, of what God&rsquo;s building is. The names of the two pillars (<a href=1Ki.htm#v7_21>v. 21</a> and <a href=1KiN.htm#n7_21x1>notes</a>) testify that the Lord will establish His building (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>) and that genuine strength is in the building (cf. <a href=Eph.htm#v3_17>Eph. 3:17</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v3_18>18</a>). In typology, bronze signifies God&rsquo;s judgment (<a href=Exo.htm#v27_1>Exo. 27:1</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v27_8>8</a>; <a href=Num.htm#v21_8>Num. 21:8</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v21_9>9</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_14>John 3:14</a>). The temple&rsquo;s two bronze pillars signify the Christ who was judged by God and who became the supporting strength of God&rsquo;s dwelling on the earth (cf. <a href=Rev.htm#v1_15>Rev. 1:15</a> and notes <a href=RevN.htm#n1_15x1>1</a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n1_15x2>2</a>). This Christ should be experienced by the believers in the church life and should be wrought into them to constitute them pillars to support God&rsquo;s building."
BD["R.g\x98"]="<b>flesh</b><br> &emsp; Flesh here, according to the context, refers to the meat of the physical body. When the Lord said, &ldquo;The bread which I will give is My flesh&rdquo; (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_51>v. 51</a>), the Jews thought that He would give them the meat of His physical body to eat (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_52>v. 52</a>). They did not understand the Lord&rsquo;s word rightly. To them it was a hard word (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_60>v. 60</a>). Hence, in this verse the Lord explained that what He would give them to eat was not the meat of His physical body; the meat, which is the flesh, profits nothing. What He would give, eventually, was the Spirit who gives life, who is the Lord Himself in resurrection."

BD["U64\x98"]="<b>excel</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word denotes to become full, to abound, to overflow; it also denotes to excel. See <a href=1CoN.htm#n8_8x1>note 8<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=1Co.htm#v8>ch. 8</a>. According to the context of this verse, the word here does not denote to abound, to increase, but to excel and be extraordinary. The words since you are zealous of spirits in the first part of this verse indicate already that in their pursuing of spiritual gifts, the Corinthian believers were confusing the Holy Spirit with the evil spirits. The apostle considered that kind of confused pursuing very demeaning, to the extent that the Corinthian believers might even have been considered barbarians. Therefore, the apostle exhorted them not to pursue some indiscernible, intermixed spiritual things for their own enjoyment and display, but to pursue so as to excel, that is, go beyond the low pursuing, for the building up of the church."

In the Bible pomegranates, being full of seeds, signify the fullness of life. The pomegranates made of linen signify the fullness of life expressed in the church&rsquo;s humanity. The sound of the bells was to warn the high priest not to be careless lest he die (<a href=Exo.htm#v28_35>v. 35</a>). That the bells were of gold signifies that the voice of warning in the church has its source in the church&rsquo;s divinity. The pomegranates and the bells signify that the church speaks out of its divinity based on the fullness of life expressed in its humanity. The expression of life and the divine sounding are signs of the proper church life."
