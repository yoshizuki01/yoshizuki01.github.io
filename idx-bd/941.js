BD[">_+\x98"]="<b>mercies</b><br> &emsp; In <a href=Act.htm#v13_34>Acts 13:34</a> Paul interprets the sure mercies as &ldquo;the holy things of David, the faithful things,&rdquo; and in <a href=Act.htm#v13_35>v. 35</a> there, he indicates that these things are Christ Himself in resurrection (see <a href=ActN.htm#n13_34x1>note 34<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Act.htm#v13>Acts 13</a>). Paul&rsquo;s interpretation is confirmed by <a href=Isa.htm#v55_4>v. 4</a> in this chapter. Christ was incarnated to bring God as grace to us (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_16>16</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v1_17>17</a>), and He was crucified and resurrected to become the sure mercies to us in resurrection. Because our situation was miserable and could not match God&rsquo;s grace, Christ, the embodiment of God&rsquo;s grace, became the sure mercies, and through these mercies we are now in the proper position to match God and receive Him as grace (cf. <a href=Eph.htm#v2_4>Eph. 2:4</a> and <a href=EphN.htm#n2_4x2>note 2</a>). In Christ as the sure mercies, God reaches us in His grace to be our enjoyment. Christ is both the sure mercies and the eternal covenant that guarantees these mercies.<br> &emsp; As the sure mercies of God, the resurrected Christ became the base of God&rsquo;s justification to His believers (<a href=Act.htm#v13_34>Acts 13:34</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v13_39>39</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v4_25>Rom. 4:25</a>). Based on such a justification in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, the believers can be sanctified by enjoying Christ, the son of David (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_1>Matt. 1:1</a>), as God&rsquo;s sure mercies, i.e., as the Holy One who did not see corruption (<a href=Act.htm#v13_35>Acts 13:35</a>)."

Even that word in Deuteronomy is related to the genealogy of Christ.<br> &emsp; Zerubbabel was one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem from the captivity in Babylon (<a href=Ezr.htm#v5_1>Ezra 5:1</a>-<a href=Ezr.htm#v5_2>2</a>).

Without the return from captivity, it would not have been possible for Christ to be born in Bethlehem. God&rsquo;s command that the captives return was not only for the rebuilding of the temple of God but also to prepare for Christ to be born in Bethlehem. Christ needed some people to be in the proper place to bring Him to earth the first time. Similarly, for His second coming Christ needs some of His people to return from their captivity to the proper church life."
