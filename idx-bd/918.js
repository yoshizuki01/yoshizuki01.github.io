BD["2.)\x98"]="<b>house</b><br> &emsp; The temple replaced the tabernacle as God&rsquo;s dwelling on earth. The temple first signifies the incarnated Christ, the embodiment of God (<a href=Col.htm#v2_9>Col. 2:9</a>), as God&rsquo;s dwelling on the earth (<a href=Joh.htm#v2_19>John 2:19</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v2_21>21</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>1:14</a>). It also signifies the church, including all the believers, the members of Christ, as the enlargement of Christ to be God&rsquo;s dwelling on the earth (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_16>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:16</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v3_17>17</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v6_19>6:19</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_21>Eph. 2:21</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>22</a>). Christ and the church are one, Christ being the Head and the church being the Body (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_22>Eph. 1:22</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v1_23>23</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v1_18>Col. 1:18a</a>). The Body is the enlargement of the Head for God&rsquo;s dwelling. Hence, God&rsquo;s dwelling in Christ is God&rsquo;s dwelling in the church.<br> &emsp; Solomon and the temple built by him typify Christ and His Body, the church, respectively, as the center, the reality, and the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy. Since Solomon and the temple play the strongest roles in the history of Israel and occupy a wide realm in such a history, they are strong evidence that the history of Israel is very much related to the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal economy in the Old Testament in the way of typology. This is a clear indication that the books of history were written from the point of view of God&rsquo;s eternal economy concerning Christ and the church.<br> &emsp; The temple was built on the ground of Mount Zion, called Mount Moriah, where Abraham offered Isaac (<a href=Gen.htm#v22_2>Gen. 22:2</a>) and David offered his sacrifice to Jehovah (<a href=1Ch.htm#v21_18>1&nbsp;Chron. 21:18</a>&mdash;<a href=1Ch.htm#v22_1>22:1</a>; <a href=2Ch.htm#v3_1>2&nbsp;Chron. 3:1</a>). This is a further indication that the Bible is a record concerning God&rsquo;s economy. Isaac was a type of Christ, who was crucified in the same place where Isaac was offered to God (see notes <a href=GenN.htm#n22_2x1>2<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v22>Gen. 22</a> and <a href=MrkN.htm#n10_1x1>1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Mrk.htm#v10>Mark 10</a>)."

This indicates that in order to pray at the incense altar, we must first have the experience at the burnt offering altar&mdash;the experience of the blood that solves the problem of our sin and our trespasses, and the experience of the fire that burns us, terminates us, and reduces us to ashes. Then we must go to the table of the bread of the Presence to enjoy Christ as our life and life supply (versus our natural conduct), to the lampstand to be enlightened by Christ as our light (versus our natural sight), and to the Ark to touch Christ as God&rsquo;s testimony (versus our entire natural being as the veil).

In this verse the burning of the fat and the inward parts of the bull on the altar was not for judgment but to produce a sweet savor for God&rsquo;s enjoyment. This burning signifies the riches and sweetness of the inner being of Christ offered to God to satisfy the requirements of His righteousness, holiness, and glory (see <a href=GenN.htm#n3_24x1>note 24<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v3>Gen. 3</a>). In <a href=Exo.htm#v29_14>v. 14</a> the burning outside the camp (signifying abandonment and judgment) of the flesh, the skin, and the dung was a burning of judgment, signifying the outward being of Christ sacrificed for the believers on the earth for their redemption (cf. <a href=Heb.htm#v13_11>Heb. 13:11</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v13_13>13</a>).
