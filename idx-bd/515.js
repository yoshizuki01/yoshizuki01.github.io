The Sabbath was a type of Christ as the rest for His people (<a href=Mat.htm#v11_28>Matt. 11:28</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v11_30>30</a>).

Blue signifies Christ&rsquo;s heavenliness; purple, His royalty, His kingliness; scarlet, His redemption accomplished by the shedding of His blood; and fine twined linen, the fine human living of Christ, manifested through His sufferings. The gold, the blue, the purple, and the scarlet were all woven into the fine twined linen to make the ephod. Therefore, the ephod typifies the composition of Christ&rsquo;s divinity, His kingliness and heavenliness, His redemption, and His fine humanity for the expression of His divine glory and human beauty. The weaving together of the gold and the linen threads in the ephod signifies the mingling of divinity and humanity in Christ, the God-man (the two natures remaining distinct in the mingling). Through Christ&rsquo;s incarnation the gold and the linen, divinity and humanity, were woven together, mingled (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>John 1:1</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>14</a>). This mingling becomes the fastening strength and binding power to hold us to Christ.<br> &emsp; The gold becoming thread indicates a process. First the gold was beaten into thin sheets, then it was cut into threads, and then it was worked into the linen (<a href=Exo.htm#v39_3>39:3</a>). The linen also had to be processed to become twined thread. This portrays that Christ became a man by passing through a process. In His human birth and through the sufferings of His human life on earth, both Christ&rsquo;s divinity and His humanity went through a process and were woven together, mingled. God&rsquo;s redeemed people (the precious stones) are fastened to Christ (Aaron) by His processed divine-human being (the ephod)."

According to <a href=Exo.htm#v26_9>v. 9</a> the sixth curtain was doubled over at the front of the tent for protection and strengthening. The hanging over of the tent at the back and on the two sides of the tabernacle indicates that after Christ was made sin and was judged by God for sinners, He became the covering and protection of the believers, who are the components of God&rsquo;s dwelling place (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n26_15x1>note 15<sup>1</sup></a>)."

Hence, the sons of Samuel should not be reckoned judges among the people of Israel (<a href=Act.htm#v13_20>Acts 13:20</a>), and their father Samuel should be considered the last judge.<br> &emsp; The only defect in Samuel&rsquo;s history was that he appointed his two sons as judges among the children of Israel.

Thus, Moses offended both God&rsquo;s holy nature and His divine economy.
