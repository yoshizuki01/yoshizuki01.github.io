BD["P-A\x97"]="<b>woman</b><br> &emsp; Since this woman&rsquo;s case is merged with the case of the ruler&rsquo;s daughter, and since the twelve years of the woman&rsquo;s sickness are the age of the girl, and both are females, one older, one younger, these cases can be considered a complete case of one person. In this view the girl was born, so to speak, in the woman&rsquo;s death-sickness and died of it. When the woman&rsquo;s death-sickness was healed by the Savior, the dead girl rose up from death. This signifies that every fallen person is born in the death-sickness of sin and is dead in sin (<a href=Eph.htm#v2_1>Eph. 2:1</a>). When his death-sickness of sin is dealt with by the Savior&rsquo;s redeeming death (<a href=1Pe.htm#v2_24>1&nbsp;Pet. 2:24</a>), he rises up out of death into life (<a href=Joh.htm#v5_24>John 5:24</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v5_25>25</a>)."

This typifies Christ as our Passover (<a href=1Co.htm#v5_7>1&nbsp;Cor. 5:7</a>). He is the redeeming Lamb of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>1:29</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v1_36>36</a>) slain for us that we may eat His flesh and drink His blood, taking Him in as our life supply that we may live by Him."

BD[")9.\x99"]="<b>water</b><br> &emsp; The water flowing out of the smitten rock typifies the Spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v7_37>John 7:37</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v7_39>39</a>). Through incarnation Christ came to the earth as a rock. On the cross He was smitten by the authority of God&rsquo;s righteous law to accomplish God&rsquo;s redemption. His side was pierced, and living water flowed out for God&rsquo;s people to drink (<a href=Joh.htm#v19_34>John 19:34</a> and <a href=JohN.htm#n19_34x1>note</a>). This living water is the water of life in resurrection, the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit as the ultimate issue of the Triune God (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>; see <a href=JohN.htm#n7_39x1>note 39<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Joh.htm#v7>John 7</a>). The source of the water of life is the throne of God and of the Lamb&mdash;the redeeming God (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>Rev. 22:1</a>). Hence, the water of life is the Triune God flowing out to be our life. The flow of the living water began from the throne in eternity, continued through the incarnation, human living, and crucifixion of Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_10>John 4:10</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v4_14>14</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v19_34>19:34</a>), and now flows on in resurrection to supply God&rsquo;s people with all the riches of the divine life (<a href=Rev.htm#v22_1>Rev. 22:1</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v22_2>2</a>). When we identify ourselves with the smitten Christ, the divine life as the living water flows out of us (<a href=Joh.htm#v7_38>John 7:38</a>). The flowing of the water of life in resurrection is for the building up of the Body of Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_13>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:13</a>) and the preparation of the bride of Christ (<a href=Rev.htm#v19_7>Rev. 19:7</a>), both of which will consummate in the New Jerusalem (<a href=Rev.htm#v21_9>Rev. 21:9</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v21_10>10</a>; cf. <a href=Eph.htm#v5_23>Eph. 5:23</a>, <a href=Eph.htm#v5_28>28</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v5_30>30</a>).<br> &emsp; To drink of the water of life, we first need to be positioned to drink (<a href=1Co.htm#v12_13>1&nbsp;Cor. 12:13</a>), and we also need to be thirsty (<a href=Joh.htm#v7_37>John 7:37</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_6>Rev. 21:6</a>). Then we need to come to the Lord (<a href=Joh.htm#v7_37>John 7:37</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v22_17>Rev. 22:17</a>), to ask of the Lord (<a href=Joh.htm#v4_10>John 4:10</a>), to believe in the Lord (<a href=Joh.htm#v7_38>John 7:38</a>), and to call on the name of the Lord (<a href=Isa.htm#v12_3>Isa. 12:3</a>-<a href=Isa.htm#v12_4>4</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v2_21>Acts 2:21</a>)."

Such a good heart works together with the seed of the divine life sown into it, allowing the seed to grow and bear fruit spontaneously for the expression of God. The word here enables us to have faith in this spontaneity. Thus, here, in contrast to <a href=Mat.htm#v13_24>Matt. 13:24</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v13_30>30</a>, tares are not mentioned, on the negative side."

BD["O7,\x97"]="<b>Honor</b><br> &emsp; The Lord&rsquo;s dealing here with the Pharisees and scribes not only condemned them for making void the word of God because of their tradition but also implied that man should honor his parents. God in His government among men has ordained that man should honor his parents. He has made this the first commandment among the Ten Commandments that concerns human relationships (<a href=Exo.htm#v20_12>Exo. 20:12</a>). Fallen human nature, however, always prompts man to ignore his parents, that is, to rebel against God&rsquo;s government. In order to bring man back to God&rsquo;s government, the Lord as the heavenly King emphasized that man should honor his parents. This corresponds with His word in the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens concerning the fulfillment of the law (<a href=Mat.htm#v5_17>5:17</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v5_19>19</a>). Hence, the apostle also emphasized this matter strongly (<a href=Eph.htm#v6_1>Eph. 6:1</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v6_3>3</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v3_20>Col. 3:20</a>). We, the kingdom people, must honor our parents and not excuse ourselves as the Jewish religionists did. To make any excuse indicates that we are not under the heavenly ruling but are following our fallen nature and the rebellious trend of today&rsquo;s generation."

This city will be the dwelling place of the restored Israel with God in the earthly part of the millennium. As such, it typifies the overcomers in the church and the overcoming saints of the Old Testament, who will be the New Jerusalem as the mutual abode of God and the overcomers in the heavenly part of the millennium (see <a href=RevN.htm#n3_12x3>note 12<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v3>Rev. 3</a>), which is the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.<br> &emsp; The history of Israel is a full type of the history of the church.

The history of the church also began with the Passover, which is the Christ who has been sacrificed (<a href=1Co.htm#v5_7>1&nbsp;Cor. 5:7</a>), and will go on until the millennium, in which the overcoming saints will be the heavenly Jerusalem, the New Jerusalem, with its twelve gates. After the one thousand years the heavenly Jerusalem will be enlarged to become the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth. She will include all the redeemed ones from both Israel and the church to be the expression of God and the mutual dwelling place of God and His redeemed in eternity future.
