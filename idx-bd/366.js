BD["i)<\x97"]="<b>mystery</b><br> &emsp; When John saw the seven stars upon the right hand of Christ and the seven golden lampstands in the midst of which was Christ, it was a mystery to him. He did not realize the significance of the seven heavenly stars and the seven golden lampstands. Hence, the Lord unveiled the mystery to him, saying that &ldquo;the seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.&rdquo; The significance of this not only was a mystery to John but also is a mystery to believers today. All believers need the unveiling of this mystery that they may see the churches and their messengers.<br> &emsp; The churches, signified by the seven golden lampstands, are the testimony of Jesus (vv. <a href=Rev.htm#v1_2>2</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v1_9>9</a>) in the divine nature, shining in the dark night locally yet collectively. The churches should be of the divine nature&mdash;golden. They should be the stands, even the lampstands, that bear the lamp with the oil (Christ as the life-giving Spirit) and shine in the darkness individually and collectively. They are individual lampstands locally, yet at the same time they are a group, a collection, of lampstands universally. They not only are shining locally but also are bearing universally the same testimony both to the localities and to the universe. They are of the same nature and in the same shape. They bear the same lamp for the same purpose and are fully identified with one another, not having any individual distinctiveness. The differences among the seven churches recorded in chs. <a href=Rev.htm#v2>2</a> and <a href=Rev.htm#v3>3</a> are all of a negative nature, not a positive one. Negatively, in their failures, the churches are different and separate from one another; but positively, in their nature, shape, and purpose, they are absolutely identical and are connected to one another.<br> &emsp; It is easy for believers to see the universal church, but it is difficult for them to see the churches. The revelation of the local churches is the Lord&rsquo;s ultimate unveiling concerning the church, and it is recorded in the last book of the divine Word. To fully know the church, believers must follow the Lord from the Gospels through the Epistles to the book of Revelation until they are enabled to see the local churches as unveiled here. In Revelation the first vision is concerning the churches. The churches with Christ as their one center are the focus in the divine administration for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.<br> &emsp; The messengers are the spiritual ones in the churches, the ones who bear the responsibility for the testimony of Jesus. They should be of the heavenly nature and should be in a heavenly position like stars. In the Acts and the Epistles the elders were the leading ones in the managing of the local churches (<a href=Act.htm#v14_23>Acts 14:23</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v20_17>20:17</a>; <a href=Tit.htm#v1_5>Titus 1:5</a>). The eldership is somewhat official, and at the time this book was written the offices in the churches had deteriorated because of the degradation of the church. In this book the Lord calls our attention back to the spiritual reality. Hence, this book emphasizes the messengers of the churches rather than the elders. The office of the elders is easily perceived, but the believers need to see the importance of the spiritual and heavenly reality of the messengers for the proper church life to bear the testimony of Jesus in the darkness of the church&rsquo;s degradation. In the first vision of this book, the vision concerning the churches, both Christ and the messengers of the churches are unveiled with the churches as never before, and this in a most particular way. For this the believers need to see a particular vision in their spirits."
BD["i-0\x97"]="<b>bowls</b><br> &emsp; The bowls are the saints&rsquo; prayers brought to God by the angelic elders (cf. <a href=Rev.htm#v8_3>8:3</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v8_4>4</a>), whereas the incense is Christ added to the saints&rsquo; prayers. See <a href=RevN.htm#n8_3x4>note 3<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v8>ch. 8</a>. That in their worship to God the twenty-four angelic elders are holding the golden bowls full of incense shows that they, as priests, are ministering to God by bringing the saints&rsquo; prayers to Him."

BD["i+6\x97"]="<b>Laodicea</b><br> &emsp; The Greek word means opinion, judgment, of the people or of the laymen. As a sign, the church in Laodicea prefigures the degraded recovered church. Less than one century after the Lord recovered the proper church in the early part of the nineteenth century, some of the recovered &ldquo;assemblies&rdquo; (called such by the Brethren) became degraded. The degraded recovered church differs from the reformed church, signified by the church in Sardis, and from the proper recovered church, signified by the church in Philadelphia. It will exist until the Lord comes back."

In the Old Testament, Christ was called &ldquo;the Angel of Jehovah&rdquo;; that Angel was God Himself (<a href=Gen.htm#v22_11>Gen. 22:11</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v22_12>12</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v3_2>Exo. 3:2</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v3_6>6</a>; <a href=Jdg.htm#v6_11>Judg. 6:11</a>-<a href=Jdg.htm#v6_24>24</a>; <a href=Zec.htm#v1_11>Zech. 1:11</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v1_12>12</a>; <a href=Zec.htm#v2_8>2:8</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v2_11>11</a>; <a href=Zec.htm#v3_1>3:1</a>-<a href=Zec.htm#v3_7>7</a>). Here in the New Testament He is again referred to as an Angel (a messenger). The expression another Angel indicates that Christ is not a common angel but a special Angel sent by God."
