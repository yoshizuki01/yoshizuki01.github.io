In such a situation the flesh of God&rsquo;s people was exposed. This shows that the shortage of Christ as our spiritual nourishment will always cause our flesh with its lusts to be exposed. After the flesh was exposed, God sent manna to nourish His people (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v16_13>13</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v16_15>15</a>). God&rsquo;s way of dealing with the flesh of His people is to change their diet. The only way to conquer the flesh is to be filled with Christ by enjoying Him daily as the heavenly life supply, signified by manna (see notes <a href=ExoN.htm#n16_4x1>4<sup>1</sup></a> and <a href=ExoN.htm#n16_15x1>15<sup>1</sup></a>)."

Now Nicodemus, one of the Pharisees, was conversing with the Lord, and the Lord spoke these familiar words. &ldquo;Water&rdquo; was the central concept of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to terminate people of the old creation. &ldquo;Spirit&rdquo; is the central concept of the ministry of Jesus, that is, to germinate people in the new creation.
