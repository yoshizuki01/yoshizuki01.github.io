BD["*)6\x97"]="<b>birds</b><br> &emsp; Offering the burnt offering at the Tent of Meeting typifies the offering of Christ to God in the church meetings. The various kinds of burnt offerings (vv. <a href=Lev.htm#v1_3>3</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v1_9>9</a>, <a href=Lev.htm#v1_10>10</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v1_13>13</a>, <a href=Lev.htm#v1_14>14</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v1_17>17</a>) differed both in size and in the way they were offered. The different sizes of burnt offerings signify not that Christ in Himself varies but that the offerers&rsquo; experience, apprehension, realization, and appreciation of Christ differ in degree. The first two categories of burnt offerings&mdash;the bull and the sheep or goat&mdash;were offered in the same way: the preparing of the offering was done by the offerer; the priest&rsquo;s function was only to sprinkle the blood on and around the altar and arrange the pieces of the offering on the fire. However, with the offerings in the third category, the offerer simply brought the offering to the Tent of Meeting; the priest did everything else. Those who offered a bull or a sheep or a goat signify the mature believers who experience and appreciate Christ in a deep and detailed way and have the spiritual ability to offer Christ in a processed way. Those who offered a turtledove or a pigeon signify believers who are young in spiritual age and who have limited experience and appreciation of Christ."

Four camps of three armies each yields the number twelve. This number, composed of three multiplied by four, signifies the Triune God (three) mingled with His creatures (four), forming a unit of eternal and perfect government (cf. <a href=RevN.htm#n21_12x2>note 12<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v21>Rev. 21</a>)."

Regardless of its kind, death is unclean, filthy and defiling. Death is the most hateful thing in the eyes of God (cf. <a href=1Co.htm#v15_26>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:26</a>).

(3) Some of the blood was put on the horns of the altar of burnt offering (vv. <a href=Lev.htm#v4_25>25a</a>, <a href=Lev.htm#v4_30>30a</a>, <a href=Lev.htm#v4_34>34a</a>), signifying that the blood of Christ is effective for our redemption (<a href=Eph.htm#v1_7>Eph. 1:7</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_18>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:18</a>-<a href=1Pe.htm#v1_19>19</a>).
