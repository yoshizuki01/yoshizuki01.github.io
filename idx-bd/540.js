They presumed that they could do whatever God required, not knowing that they were unable to fulfill His commandments and that they stood in need of His mercy. Even before the decree of the law had been completed, the people fell into the sin of idolatry, breaking at least the first three of the Ten Commandments (<a href=Exo.htm#v20_2>20:2</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v20_7>7</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v32_1>32:1</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v32_6>6</a> and <a href=ExoN.htm#n32_1x1>notes</a>). After the people spoke this word, God changed His attitude toward them and also caused a change of atmosphere (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v19_9>9</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v19_12>12</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v19_13>13</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v19_16>16</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v19_25>25</a>; <a href=Exo.htm#v20_18>20:18</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v20_19>19</a>; cf. <a href=Exo.htm#v19_3>19:3</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v19_6>6</a>).<br> &emsp; God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to have a people to be His counterpart, His expression, and His dwelling place. In order to fulfill this purpose, God must impart Himself as life into His chosen people and work Himself into them. From the very beginning it was not God&rsquo;s intention to give man commandments to keep or to have man do things for Him (see <a href=GenN.htm#n2_17x1>note 17<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v2>Gen. 2</a>). Likewise, in bringing the children of Israel to the mountain of God, it was not God&rsquo;s intention to give them a list of divine commandments as requirements for them to fulfill. Rather, His intention was to bring His people into His presence so that He could reveal Himself to them and impart Himself into them through His speaking to them (cf. <a href=Exo.htm#v34_28>34:28</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v34_29>29</a> and <a href=ExoN.htm#n34_29x1>note 29<sup>1</sup></a>). God&rsquo;s people, however, did not understand His intention. Their natural, fallen, and religious concept was that God wanted them to do certain things for Him, and they thought they were able to do these things. Since this was their concept, it was necessary for God to give them commandments to show them how high His requirements are and how unable to fulfill these requirements they were (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_3>Rom. 8:3a</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v8_7>7</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_8>8</a>).<br> &emsp; The law decreed by God on Mount Sinai has both a positive and a negative function. On the positive side the law functions as God&rsquo;s testimony, revealing God to His people (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n20_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v20>ch. 20</a>). The law is also God&rsquo;s living word as His breath (<a href=2Ti.htm#v3_16>2&nbsp;Tim. 3:16</a>) to infuse His element into His loving seekers (see <a href=DeuN.htm#n8_3x1>note 3<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Deu.htm#v8>Deut. 8</a>). On the negative side, the function of the law is to expose sin (<a href=Rom.htm#v3_20>Rom. 3:20</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v5_20>5:20</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v7_7>7:7</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v7_8>8</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v7_13>13</a>), to subdue sinners (<a href=Rom.htm#v3_19>Rom. 3:19</a>), and to guard God&rsquo;s chosen people and bring them to Christ (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_23>Gal. 3:23</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v3_24>24</a>). Whether in our experience the law is positive or negative depends on the condition of our heart in receiving the law. If we love God, humble ourselves, and regard the law as His living word through which we contact Him and abide in Him, the law will become a channel through which the divine life and substance are conveyed to us for our supply and nourishment. Being infused with God&rsquo;s substance through the law as God&rsquo;s word, we will become one with God in life, nature, and expression and will spontaneously live a life that expresses God and corresponds to His law (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_4>Rom. 8:4</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>Phil. 1:21a</a>). However, if in coming to the law we do not seek God in love but rather separate the law from the living God as the source of life (cf. <a href=Joh.htm#v5_39>John 5:39</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v5_40>40</a>), the law, which was intended to result in life (<a href=Rom.htm#v7_10>Rom. 7:10</a>) but cannot give life of itself (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_21>Gal. 3:21</a> and <a href=GalN.htm#n3_21x1>note 1</a>), will become a condemning and killing element to us (<a href=Rom.htm#v7_11>Rom. 7:11</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_6>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:6</a>-<a href=2Co.htm#v3_7>7</a>, <a href=2Co.htm#v3_9>9</a>).

BD["R.7\x8c"]="Then Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and take <I>Him</I> by force to make Him King, withdrew again to the mountain, Himself alone."
BD["Q)K\x98"]="<b>overshadow</b><br> &emsp; Like the overshadowing of the cloud on the Mount of Transfiguration (<a href=Mat.htm#v17_5>Matt. 17:5</a>) and over the tabernacle (<a href=Exo.htm#v40_34>Exo. 40:34</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v40_38>38</a>). According to this verse, it seems that the Holy Spirit would be only upon Mary as the power for her to conceive the holy child. However, <a href=Mat.htm#v1_18>Matt. 1:18</a> and <a href=Mat.htm#v1_20>20</a> tell us that Mary &ldquo;was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This indicates that the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit had been begotten in Mary&rsquo;s womb before she delivered the child Jesus. Such a conception of the Holy Spirit in the human virgin, accomplished with the divine and human essences, constituted a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature, which produced a God-man, One who is both the complete God and the perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctly, without a third nature being produced. This is the most wonderful and most excellent person of Jesus, who is Jehovah the Savior.<br> &emsp; The conception of John the Baptist was strikingly different in essence from that of Jesus the Savior. The conception of the Baptist was God&rsquo;s miracle, accomplished with the overage human essence, merely by the divine power without the involvement of the divine essence. This resulted in the bringing forth of a mere man who was filled with the Spirit of God (<a href=Luk.htm#v1_15>v. 15</a>) but who lacked the nature of God. The conception of the Savior was God&rsquo;s incarnation (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_14>John 1:14</a>), constituted not only by the divine power but also of the divine essence added to the human essence, thus producing the God-man of two natures&mdash;divinity and humanity. Through this, God joined Himself to humanity that He might be manifested in the flesh (<a href=1Ti.htm#v3_16>1&nbsp;Tim. 3:16</a>) and might be a Man-Savior (<a href=Luk.htm#v2_11>2:11</a>)."
BD["R-:\x8c"]="Because of this therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God."
BD["R,=\x8c"]="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father."
BD["R+\@\x8c"]="For John had not yet been thrown into prison."
BD[",4*\x97"]="<b>destroy</b><br> &emsp; Before the children of Israel could have the full enjoyment of the riches of the good land, they had to utterly destroy the heathen places of worship, the idols, and the names of the idols (vv. <a href=Deu.htm#v12_2>2</a>-<a href=Deu.htm#v12_3>3</a>). Thus, the good land was to be thoroughly cleared of all the heathen centers of worship. The children of Israel were not to worship God in the same way that the nations worshipped their gods (<a href=Deu.htm#v12_4>v. 4</a>)."
