Our being is of three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body (<a href=1Th.htm#v5_23>1&nbsp;Thes. 5:23</a>), and our soul is different from our spirit. At the time that we believed in the Lord Jesus and were saved, our spirit was regenerated with the Spirit of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_6>John 3:6</a>). But we must wait until the Lord Jesus comes back for our body to be redeemed, saved, and transfigured (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_23>Rom. 8:23</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v8_25>25</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v3_21>Phil. 3:21</a>). Concerning the saving, or gaining, of our soul, it depends on how we deal with our soul in following the Lord after we are saved and regenerated. If we lose our soul now for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, we will save it (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_25>Matt. 16:25</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v9_24>Luke 9:24</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v17_33>17:33</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v12_25>John 12:25</a>; <a href=1Pe.htm#v1_9>1&nbsp;Pet. 1:9</a>), and it will be saved, or gained, at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_37>v. 37</a>). This gaining of the soul will be the reward (<a href=Heb.htm#v10_35>v. 35</a>) of the kingdom to the overcoming followers of the Lord (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_22>Matt. 16:22</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_28>28</a>)."
