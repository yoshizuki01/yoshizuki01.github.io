BD[")JC\x97"]="<b>speaking</b><br> &emsp; Lit., mouth. God&rsquo;s speaking in this chapter is a repetition of what He spoke in chs. <a href=Exo.htm#v20>20</a>&mdash;<a href=Exo.htm#v23>23</a>. The focus of this repeated speaking is not on the keeping of the Ten Commandments and the ordinances of the law but on the enjoyment of God through the enjoyment of the riches of the good land and the repeated feasting and resting with Him. This matches the focus of the New Testament teaching, which is concerned primarily with the enjoyment of Christ (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_9>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:9</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v5_8>5:8</a>). It was not God&rsquo;s intention merely to have a people to keep His commandments and ordinances. God&rsquo;s intention was to dispense Himself into His chosen people so that they would be fully infused with Him in order to express Him (see <a href=ExoN.htm#n34_29x1>note 29<sup>1</sup></a>)."

BD["Z)>\x8c"]="He now has reconciled in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and without reproach before Him;"
BD["Z*7\x98"]="<b>rulers</b><br> &emsp; These are the angelic rulers and authorities. Because at Colossae there was the heretical teaching of angel worship, the passage here must refer to the evil angels. The law was ordained through angels and was even considered to be ordinances of angels (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_19>Gal. 3:19</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v7_53>Acts 7:53</a>). Based on this, the heresy at Colossae taught people to worship angels (<a href=Col.htm#v2_18>v. 18</a>) as mediators between God and man. The apostle dealt with this heresy by unveiling the fact that the law, consisting of ordinances, had been nailed to the cross (<a href=Col.htm#v2_14>v. 14</a>), and that the leading evil angels had been stripped off from God. This left Christ as the sole Mediator, who is the Head of all rule and authority (<a href=Col.htm#v2_10>v. 10</a>). This killed the heresy of angel worship."
BD["U7=\x98"]="<b>man</b><br> &emsp; I.e., Christ, the second man (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_47>v. 47</a>). Adam brought in death through sin (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_12>Rom. 5:12</a>); Christ brought in the life of resurrection through righteousness (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_17>Rom. 5:17</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v5_18>18</a>). The death brought in by Adam works in us from our birth by our parents until the death of our body. The life of resurrection brought in by Christ operates in us, as signified by baptism (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_4>Rom. 6:4</a>), from our regeneration by the Spirit of God (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_5>John 3:5</a>) until the transfiguration of our body (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_21>Phil. 3:21</a>)."

BD["+L+\x97"]="<b>are</b><br> &emsp; Lit., become wives for. So throughout this chapter."
BD["[*.\x98"]="<b>stood</b><br> &emsp; Or, asserted authority. Lit., been able to be in weight; i.e., been burdensome (cf. <a href=1Th.htm#v2_9>v. 9</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v9_4>1&nbsp;Cor. 9:4</a>-<a href=1Co.htm#v9_12>12</a>). To assert authority, dignity, or right in Christian work damages that work. The Lord Jesus, while on earth, gave up His dignity (<a href=Joh.htm#v13_4>John 13:4</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v13_5>5</a>), and the apostle preferred not to use his right (<a href=1Co.htm#v9_12>1&nbsp;Cor. 9:12</a>)."
BD["+K.\x97"]="<b>cities</b><br> &emsp; The cities of refuge typify the all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the redeeming God, into whom mistaken sinners can flee for refuge. Christ was delivered by God into the hands of sinners (<a href=Act.htm#v2_23>Acts 2:23</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v4_25>Rom. 4:25</a>), who mistakenly put Him to death (<a href=Luk.htm#v23_34>Luke 23:34</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v2_8>1&nbsp;Cor. 2:8</a>). If any sinner repents, God will regard him as a mistaken sinner and will forgive him (<a href=Luk.htm#v24_47>Luke 24:47</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v2_38>Acts 2:38</a>). Such a one may flee into Christ. But if anyone refuses the gospel and does not repent, God will regard him as a willful sinner, one who is destined to perish (<a href=Num.htm#v35_16>v. 16</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v3_16>John 3:16</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_18>18</a>).<br> &emsp; There were six cities of refuge, three on each side of the Jordan (<a href=Num.htm#v35_14>v. 14</a>). The number six signifies mistake-making man, who was created by God on the sixth day (<a href=Gen.htm#v1_26>Gen. 1:26</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v1_27>27</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v1_31>31</a>). The number three signifies the Triune God as the refuge for the man who makes mistakes. The number two (the two sets of three cities each) signifies a testimony standing in the universe, testifying and declaring to the universe that the Triune God is living on earth among human beings to be their city of refuge."
BD["4+=\x97"]="<b>sons</b><br> &emsp; Lit., son."
BD["[)1\x98"]="<b>turned</b><br> &emsp; To turn to God from the idols, to serve a living and true God, and to await His Son from the heavens are the three basic substances of the Christian life as viewed from another angle. To turn to God from the idols is to turn away not only from the false gods, together with the devil and the demons behind them, but also from all things other than God. This is accomplished by faith infused into the new converts through their hearing of the word of the gospel. To serve a living and true God is to serve the very God who is triune&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;who has been processed to be the believers&rsquo; life and life supply for their enjoyment. They should experience Him not only as the object of worship but also as the all-inclusive Supplier who lives in them. This experience is brought about by love produced within the believers by the sweet taste of the rich supply of the Father, through the Son, and in the Spirit. To await the Son of God from the heavens is to look for the One who passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion and entered into resurrection and ascended to the heavens, and who will come back to receive His believers into glory. This is the hope that strengthens the believers to stand steadfastly in their faith."

BD["Q?M\x8c"]="And saying, If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!"
BD["*BR\x97"]="<b>remember</b><br> &emsp; God remembering His covenants and the land signifies that for the church in captivity God remembers His new covenant (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_10>Heb. 8:10</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v8_12>12</a>) and Christ as the rich land (<a href=Col.htm#v1_12>Col. 1:12</a>)."

As the Word of God, the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ Himself, who has become the life-giving Spirit as the breath breathed out by the speaking God (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v20_22>John 20:22</a>), is the word of the law&mdash;including the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances (judgments)&mdash;rehearsed by Moses in this book. Thus, every word in this book is the very Christ, who is now the word of God for us to receive as our life and life supply by calling on Him (<a href=Rom.htm#v10_12>Rom. 10:12</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v10_13>13</a>). See notes <a href=DeuN.htm#n8_3x1>3<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Deu.htm#v8>ch. 8</a> and <a href=PsaN.htm#n119_9x1>9<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Psa.htm#v119>Psa. 119</a>."
BD["SB2\x8c"]="Which also I did in Jerusalem; and I both shut up many of the saints in prison when I had received authority from the chief priests and cast a vote against them when they were being done away with."

BD["S\@8\x8c"]="Because of this I also exercise myself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men."
BD["R;L\x98"]="<b>bone</b><br> &emsp; In the Scripture the first mention of a bone is in <a href=Gen.htm#v2_21>Gen. 2:21</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_23>23</a>; there it was a rib taken out of Adam for the producing and building of Eve as a match for Adam. Eve was a type of the church, which is produced and built with the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life released out of Him. Hence, the bone is a symbol, a figure, of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life, which nothing can break. The Lord&rsquo;s side was pierced, but not one of His bones was broken. This signifies that although the Lord&rsquo;s physical life was terminated, His resurrection life, the very divine life, could not be hurt or damaged by anything. This is the life with which the church is produced and built; it is also the eternal life, which we have obtained by believing into Him (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_36>3:36</a>)."

BD["X-\@\x98"]="<b>everything</b><br> &emsp; According to the divine ordination, the subjection of wives to their husbands should be absolute, without any choice. This does not mean that they should obey their husbands in everything. Obeying is different from being subject. With obedience, the emphasis is on compliance, whereas with subjection, the emphasis is on subordination. In sinful things, things against God and the Lord, wives should not obey their husbands. However, they should still be in subjection to them. In a similar situation, Daniel&rsquo;s three friends disobeyed the Babylonian king&rsquo;s order to worship the idol, yet still subjected themselves to the king&rsquo;s authority (<a href=Dan.htm#v3_13>Dan. 3:13</a>-<a href=Dan.htm#v3_23>23</a>)."
