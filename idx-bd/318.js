In Mark the record of these events is much more detailed than in Matthew. This is strong evidence that Mark&rsquo;s Gospel, as a biography of the Slave of God, stresses His work instead of His word, giving more details than the other Gospels."

BD["P*2\x97"]="<b>Man</b><br> &emsp; The Slave-Savior was the very God incarnated. As such, He did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped. Outwardly, He was in the likeness and fashion of man, even in the form of a slave, but inwardly, He was God (<a href=Phi.htm#v2_6>Phil. 2:6</a>-<a href=Phi.htm#v2_7>7</a>). He was the Slave-Savior, and the God-Savior as well. Hence, He had not only the ability to save sinners but also the authority to forgive their sins. In this incident, although He as God forgave people&rsquo;s sins, He asserted that He was the Son of Man. This indicates that He was the true God and a real man, possessing deity and humanity. In Him men could see both His divine attributes and His human virtues."

This indicates that the more inward we progress in our experience of God&rsquo;s building, the higher we become. The number eight signifies resurrection. This indicates that if we would come into the inner court, we need to be in resurrection. All the natural life and the natural man must be repudiated and crossed out."
