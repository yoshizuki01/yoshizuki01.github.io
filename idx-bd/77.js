BD["a+)\x99"]="<b>heavenly</b><br> &emsp; The concept of this book is focused on the heavenly nature of the positive things. First, it points out to us that Christ today is sitting in the heavens (<a href=Heb.htm#v1_3>1:3</a>). He entered into the heavens (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_24>9:24</a>). He passed through the heavens (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_14>4:14</a>) and became higher than the heavens (<a href=Heb.htm#v7_26>7:26</a>). Then this book unfolds to us the heavenly calling (<a href=Heb.htm#v3_1>v. 1</a>), the heavenly gift (<a href=Heb.htm#v6_4>6:4</a>), the heavenly things (<a href=Heb.htm#v8_5>8:5</a>), the heavenly country (<a href=Heb.htm#v11_16>11:16</a>), and the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_22>12:22</a>). Also, it tells us that we are enrolled in the heavens (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_23>12:23</a>) and that God warns us today from the heavens (<a href=Heb.htm#v12_25>12:25</a>). All the things in the Old Testament that were held by Judaism were of an earthly nature. In this book the writer&rsquo;s intention was to show the Hebrew Christians the contrast between the heavenly nature of the New Testament and the earthly nature of the Old Testament that they might forsake the earthly things and attach themselves to the heavenly."
