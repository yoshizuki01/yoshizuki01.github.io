In spiritual experience, when we meet with God upon Christ as the propitiation cover, enjoying fellowship with God and hearing words from His mouth, the Ark becomes the table of the bread of the Presence, where we enjoy a nourishing feast.

To store up treasures in heaven is to &ldquo;send&rdquo; our money to heaven, and to do this is to &ldquo;heave up&rdquo; our money (cf. <a href=Phi.htm#v4_18>Phil. 4:18</a>)."

For Bethel, God&rsquo;s house, the idols must be removed (<a href=2Co.htm#v6_16>2&nbsp;Cor. 6:16</a>). Furthermore, everything impure, filthy, or defiled must be cleansed away (<a href=2Co.htm#v7_1>2&nbsp;Cor. 7:1</a>). For the realizing of Bethel, the old man with his old manner of life, signified by the old garments (<a href=Isa.htm#v64_6>Isa. 64:6</a>), must also be put off, and the new man with his new manner of life, the church life, must be put on (<a href=Eph.htm#v4_22>Eph. 4:22</a>-<a href=Eph.htm#v4_24>24</a>)."

BD["X)-\x98"]="<b>sonship</b><br> &emsp; God&rsquo;s marking us out beforehand was to destine us unto sonship. We were predestinated to be sons of God even before we were created. Hence, as God&rsquo;s creatures we need to be regenerated by Him that we may participate in His life to be His sons. Sonship implies having not only the life but also the position of a son. God&rsquo;s marked-out ones have the life to be His sons and the position to inherit Him. To be made holy&mdash;to be sanctified by God by His putting Himself into us and then mingling His nature with us&mdash;is the process, the procedure, whereas to be sons of God is the aim, the goal, and is a matter of our being joined to the Son of God and conformed to a particular form or shape, the very image of the firstborn Son of God (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_29>Rom. 8:29</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v1_15>Col. 1:15</a>), that our whole being, including our body (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_23>Rom. 8:23</a>), may be &ldquo;sonized&rdquo; by God."
