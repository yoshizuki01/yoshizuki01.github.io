In the Epistles the throne is the throne of grace, from which we receive mercy and find grace (<a href=Heb.htm#v4_16>Heb. 4:16</a>). In this book the throne is the throne of judgment, from which the world receives judgment. Eventually, after all God&rsquo;s judgments have been executed, the throne of God will be the throne of the supply of eternal life, out of which will proceed the living water of life, in which the tree of life grows, as the supply of God&rsquo;s redeemed in eternity."

BD["i+-\x98"]="<b>clothed</b><br> &emsp; Being clothed in white garments, as promised here, will be a prize to the overcomers in the millennial kingdom. What they have been walking in in this age will be a prize to them in the coming age. Every Christian needs two garments. The first is the garment of justification for our salvation, signifying Christ, the Christ whom we received, as our objective righteousness (<a href=Luk.htm#v15_22>Luke 15:22</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>). The second is the garment of approvedness for our acceptance, signifying Christ, the Christ whom we live out, as our subjective righteousness (<a href=Phi.htm#v1_21>Phil. 1:21</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v3_9>3:9</a>). The white garments mentioned here refer to the second garment, which is needed for us to receive the reward and enter into the kingdom to walk with the Lord, that is, to reign with Him (<a href=2Ti.htm#v2_11>2&nbsp;Tim. 2:11</a>-<a href=2Ti.htm#v2_12>12</a>).

BD["i*/\x9b"]="<b>eat</b><br> &emsp; Religion always teaches, but the Lord feeds (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_35>John 6:35</a>). The apostle Paul did the same thing; that is, he fed the believers (<a href=1Co.htm#v3_2>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:2</a>). For the proper church life and the recovery of the church life, that is, for the proper growth in the Christian life, what we need is not merely the mental apprehension of teachings but the eating of the Lord as our bread of life in our spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v6_57>John 6:57</a>). Even the words of the Scripture should not be considered merely as doctrines to teach our mind but as food to nourish our spirit (<a href=Mat.htm#v4_4>Matt. 4:4</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v5_12>Heb. 5:12</a>-<a href=Heb.htm#v5_14>14</a>). Here in this epistle the Lord promised to give the overcomer to eat of the tree of life. This points back to <a href=Gen.htm#v2_8>Gen. 2:8</a>-<a href=Gen.htm#v2_9>9</a>, <a href=Gen.htm#v2_16>16</a>, which concerns the matter of eating ordained by God. In the epistle to the church in Pergamos, the Lord promised the overcomer that he would eat of the hidden manna (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_17>v. 17</a>), which refers to the eating of manna by the children of Israel in the wilderness (<a href=Exo.htm#v16_14>Exo. 16:14</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v16_16>16</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v16_31>31</a>). And in the epistle to the church in Laodicea, the Lord promised to dine with the one who opens the door to Him. To dine is to eat not merely one kind of food but the riches of a feast. This may refer to the eating of the rich produce of the good land of Canaan by the children of Israel (<a href=Jos.htm#v5_10>Josh. 5:10</a>-<a href=Jos.htm#v5_12>12</a>). This indicates that the Lord desires to recover the eating of the proper food by God&rsquo;s people, the food ordained by God and typified by the tree of life, the manna, and the produce of the good land, all of which are types of the various aspects of Christ as food to us. The degradation of the church distracts God&rsquo;s people from the eating of Christ as their food and turns them to the teaching of doctrines for knowledge. In the church&rsquo;s degradation there are the teaching of Balaam (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_14>v. 14</a>), the teaching of the Nicolaitans (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_15>v. 15</a>), the teaching by Jezebel (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_20>v. 20</a>), and the teaching of the deep things of Satan (<a href=Rev.htm#v2_24>v. 24</a>). Now in these epistles the Lord came to recover the proper eating of Himself as our food supply. We must eat Him not only as the tree of life and the hidden manna but also as a feast full of His riches."
BD["?90\x97"]="<b>tree</b><br> &emsp; According to God&rsquo;s economy, the one who trusts in God is like a tree planted by water, signifying God as the fountain of living waters (<a href=Jer.htm#v2_13>2:13a</a>). A tree grows beside a river by absorbing all the riches of the water. This is a picture of God&rsquo;s economy, which is carried out by His dispensing. In order to receive the divine dispensing, we as the trees must absorb God as the water (cf. <a href=1Co.htm#v3_6>1&nbsp;Cor. 3:6</a>). The riches of the supplying God dispensed into us as the trees constitute us with God&rsquo;s divinity and cause us to grow into God&rsquo;s measure (<a href=Col.htm#v2_19>Col. 2:19</a>). In this way we and God become one, having the same element, essence, constitution, and appearance (<a href=Rev.htm#v4_3>Rev. 4:3</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v21_11>21:11</a>)."
