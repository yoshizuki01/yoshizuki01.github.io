BD["*8)\x97"]="<b>Then</b><br> &emsp; Because of the negative situation of God&rsquo;s people, as portrayed in chs. <a href=Lev.htm#v11>11</a>&mdash;<a href=Lev.htm#v15>15</a>, according to God&rsquo;s concept and in His divine economy there is the need of redemption. Because the Old Testament time was not the time for redemption to take place, a type, a shadow, of the coming redemption was needed. This shadow is the expiation in this chapter. The expiation accomplished through the animal sacrifices in the Old Testament is a type pointing to the redemption accomplished by Christ in the New Testament.<br> &emsp; The root of the Hebrew word translated expiation means to cover. The noun form of this word is rendered expiation cover in <a href=Lev.htm#v16_2>v. 2</a> and in <a href=Exo.htm#v25_17>Exo. 25:17</a>. The root of the Greek word used in the Septuagint and in the New Testament, translated propitiation in <a href=Rom.htm#v3_25>Rom. 3:25</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v2_17>Heb. 2:17</a>; and <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_2>1&nbsp;John 2:2</a> and <a href=1Jo.htm#v4_10>4:10</a>, means to appease (the situation between two parties). On the Day of Expiation the blood of the sin offering was brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled on the expiation cover, the lid of the Ark (vv. <a href=Lev.htm#v16_14>14</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v16_15>15</a>), which covered the Ten Commandments within the Ark (<a href=Exo.htm#v25_16>Exo. 25:16</a>), signifying that the sin of the ones coming to contact God had been covered but not yet removed (see <a href=HebN.htm#n1_3x3>note 3<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v1>Heb. 1</a>). In this way the situation of fallen man in relation to God was appeased but was not fully settled, until Christ came to accomplish redemption by offering Himself as the propitiatory sacrifice to take away man&rsquo;s sin (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_12>Heb. 9:12</a>; <a href=Heb.htm#v2_17>2:17</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v2_2>1&nbsp;John 2:2</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v4_10>4:10</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>John 1:29</a>). See notes <a href=RomN.htm#n3_25x2>25<sup>2</sup></a> and <a href=RomN.htm#n3_25x3>25<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Rom.htm#v3>Rom. 3</a>, <a href=HebN.htm#n2_17x4>17<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v2>Heb. 2</a>, <a href=HebN.htm#n9_12x2>12<sup>2</sup></a> in <a href=Heb.htm#v9>Heb. 9</a>, and <a href=1JoN.htm#n2_2x1>2<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=1Jo.htm#v2>1&nbsp;John 2</a>."

Because we were born in uncleanness (<a href=Lev.htm#v12_1>12:1</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v12_8>8</a>; <a href=Psa.htm#v51_5>Psa. 51:5</a>) and are a totality of uncleanness, whatever issues out of our natural being as a discharge is both unclean and contagious, causing everyone, everything, and every place to be defiled."

The sprinkling of the blood seven times signifies the completeness of the cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood (<a href=1Jo.htm#v1_7>1&nbsp;John 1:7</a>, <a href=1Jo.htm#v1_9>9</a>)."
BD["/))\x97"]="<b>ruled</b><br> &emsp; Lit., judged. Ruth is an appendix to the book of Judges, contemporary with the first half of Judges. Judges is a book of Israel&rsquo;s miserable history, dark and foul; Ruth is the record of a couple&rsquo;s excellent story, bright and aromatic. The main character in this story is like a lily growing out of brambles and a bright star in the dark night.<br> &emsp; The book of Ruth is an important part of the genealogy of Christ (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_5>Matt. 1:5</a>), which is the record concerning the incarnation of Christ. As a Moabitess (<a href=Rut.htm#v1_4>v. 4</a>), Ruth was excluded from the congregation of God&rsquo;s holy people (<a href=Deu.htm#v23_3>Deut. 23:3</a>). Nevertheless, she was brought into the holy elect of God and became an important ancestor of Christ through her marriage to Boaz, the great-grandfather of King David (<a href=Rut.htm#v4_21>4:21</a>-<a href=Rut.htm#v4_22>22</a>; <a href=Mat.htm#v1_5>Matt. 1:5</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v1_6>6</a>), which became a factor that ushered in the incarnation of Christ (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_5>Matt. 1:5</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v1_16>16</a>). Hence, Ruth became an important ancestor to bring Christ into humanity through the marvelous incarnation, which made God one with man (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_18>Matt. 1:18</a>, <a href=Mat.htm#v1_20>20b</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v1_23>23</a>). This is the intrinsic significance of the content of the book of Ruth. See <a href=MatN.htm#n1_5x3>note 5<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Mat.htm#v1>Matt. 1</a>."

BD["*2;\x97"]="<b>eaten</b><br> &emsp; Due to their weakness concerning God&rsquo;s judgment on Nadab and Abihu, Aaron and his sons were not fit to eat the sin offering (vv. <a href=Lev.htm#v10_16>16</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v10_17>17</a>, <a href=Lev.htm#v10_19>19</a>-<a href=Lev.htm#v10_20>20</a>). This signifies that if we are weak in accepting God&rsquo;s judgment on the serving ones who are intimate and close to us, we will not be able to partake of Christ as our sin offering in the way of taking His sinless life as our life supply so that we can minister Him to the believers as the life that deals with their sin.<br> &emsp; On the one hand, Aaron and his sons were weak concerning God&rsquo;s judgment; on the other hand, Aaron had a proper consideration, for he and his sons were sorrowful and unhappy, and eating the sin offering under such circumstances would not have been pleasing to the Lord. Aaron&rsquo;s response pleased Moses, who represented God (<a href=Lev.htm#v10_20>v. 20</a>). Aaron and his sons had not followed the divine regulation in a legal way, not because of disobedience but because of a positive consideration of their circumstances. This incident indicates that with respect to keeping the regulations made by God, in God&rsquo;s mercy there is a margin for consideration. What Aaron and his sons did was seemingly against God&rsquo;s regulation, but actually it was something done in wisdom."
