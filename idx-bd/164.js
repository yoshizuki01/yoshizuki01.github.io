Hence, the unique Leader of God&rsquo;s people is not any man (cf. vv. <a href=Num.htm#v10_29>29</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v10_32>32</a>) but is the crucified and resurrected Christ (<a href=Mat.htm#v23_10>Matt. 23:10</a>).

The two sets of the five curtains joined to one another (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v26_4>4</a>-<a href=Exo.htm#v26_6>6</a>) signify the continuous life of the Lord Jesus as a life of responsibility for a testimony.<br> &emsp; The joining of the two sets of five curtains resulted in a large sheet measuring forty cubits by twenty-eight cubits.

Our soul-life is embodied in and lived out by our self, and our self is expressed through our mind, our thought, our concept, our opinion. When we set our mind not on the things of God but on the things of men, our mind grasps the opportunity to act and express itself. This was what happened with Peter. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s subsequent word indicated that Peter had to deny himself, i.e., not save his soul-life but lose it. Losing the soul-life is the reality of denying the self.

The manna preserved in the golden pot was the center of the tabernacle, God&rsquo;s dwelling place in the Old Testament; likewise, the Christ whom we have eaten, digested, and assimilated is the center of our being as a part of the church, God&rsquo;s dwelling place today (<a href=2Ti.htm#v4_22>2&nbsp;Tim. 4:22</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v2_22>Eph. 2:22</a>).<br> &emsp; <a href=Rev.htm#v2_17>Revelation 2:17</a> indicates that the overcomers, who overcome the degradation of the worldly church, will be given to eat the hidden manna and will be given a white stone (see notes <a href=RevN.htm#n2_17x2>17<sup>2</sup></a> and <a href=RevN.htm#n2_17x3>17<sup>3</sup></a> in <a href=Rev.htm#v2>Rev. 2</a>).

BD["+:1\x97"]="<b>kept</b><br> &emsp; All the portions of the sons of Israel were offered to God through fire for His enjoyment. God kept some parts of the offerings from the fire that they might become the portion of the priests. This means that the priests enjoyed what God enjoyed, all of which typify Christ. God&rsquo;s delight, enjoyment, and satisfaction is the Son of God, Jesus Christ (<a href=Mat.htm#v3_17>Matt. 3:17</a>). Hence, both God and His serving ones, the priests, enjoy the same portion&mdash;the all-inclusive Christ."

However, they still complained. This shows the perverseness of the rebellious nature of fallen mankind (cf. <a href=Rev.htm#v20_7>Rev. 20:7</a>-<a href=Rev.htm#v20_9>9</a>). It is no wonder that none of these children of Israel, except Joshua and Caleb, were permitted to enter into the promised land (<a href=Num.htm#v14_28>14:28</a>-<a href=Num.htm#v14_30>30</a>)."

BD["R6+\x98"]="<b>prepare</b><br> &emsp; The Lord&rsquo;s intention in this chapter was to bring man into God for the building of His dwelling place. But between man and God there were many obstacles, such as sin, sins, death, the world, the flesh, the self, the old man, and Satan. For the Lord to bring man into God, He had to solve all these problems. Therefore, He had to go to the cross to accomplish redemption that He might open the way and make a standing for man, that man might enter into God. This standing in God, being enlarged, becomes the standing in the Body of Christ. Anyone who does not have a standing, a place, in God does not have a place in the Body of Christ, which is God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s going in order to accomplish redemption was to prepare a place in His Body for the disciples."
