BD["S*P\x99"]="<b>generation</b><br> &emsp; At the conclusion of his message Peter did not say, &ldquo;Be saved from God&rsquo;s condemnation,&rdquo; or &ldquo;from eternal perdition,&rdquo; but, &ldquo;Be saved from this crooked generation.&rdquo; The crooked generation refers to the perverted Jews in that age, who rejected God&rsquo;s Christ (<a href=Act.htm#v2_36>v. 36</a>) and were considered by God as the &ldquo;present evil age&rdquo; (<a href=Gal.htm#v1_4>Gal. 1:4</a>). For the crooked Jews to be saved from their present evil age required a genuine repentance concerning their crookedness toward God and a real turn to God. This indicates that they needed to turn to God not only from their sins but also from their generation, their Jewish society, including their Jewish religion. The result of such a salvation was not their entering into heaven but their entering into a new generation&mdash;the church. Thus, the saved ones were separated from the Jewish society into the church. Being saved in this way implies being saved from God&rsquo;s condemnation and eternal perdition unto God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and His pleasure (<a href=Eph.htm#v3_11>Eph. 3:11</a>; <a href=Eph.htm#v1_9>1:9</a>)."

This signifies Christ&rsquo;s redemption issuing out of God&rsquo;s righteous judgment. The capitals signify glory as a crown, whereas the hooks signify holding power, and the rods, joining strength. Christ&rsquo;s redemption is our glory as well as the holding power and the joining strength to link us, the pillars, to God&rsquo;s righteousness and to join us to one another. The elements of the court of the tabernacle show that if we submit to God&rsquo;s divine judgment (bronze), we will simultaneously experience the redemption of Christ (silver), which links us to God&rsquo;s righteousness (linen) as the expression and testimony of God."

BD["U1)\x99"]="<b>apostle</b><br> &emsp; As he presented himself a pattern to the believers, the apostle came to the matter of his apostleship, which gave him authority to deal with all the problems covered in this book, serious problems concerning the church life and its fellowship. His handling of these problems was based not only on his teaching but also on the authority inherent in his apostleship. To deal with the situation, he had to take this standing and make this matter clear to the Corinthian believers. They had questioned his apostleship and were in a chaotic situation, mainly because of the foolishness of their worldly wisdom, self-confidence, and pride.<br> &emsp; The Greek word for apostle means one who is sent. An apostle of the Lord is a believer who is sent out by Him with His authority to preach the gospel of God, to teach the divine truth, and to establish churches. In the first section of Acts, Peter and John were such apostles among the Jews, and in the second section of Acts, Paul and Barnabas were such apostles among the Gentiles. After them, others also became apostles, such as Silas (i.e., Silvanus) and Timothy (<a href=1Th.htm#v1_1>1&nbsp;Thes. 1:1</a>; <a href=1Th.htm#v2_6>2:6</a>). As long as one has the power to preach the gospel, the gift to teach the divine truth, and the ability to establish churches, he is qualified and confirmed to be an apostle sent by the Lord with His commission and authority."
