The Ark was the place where God met with people. In the Ark was the law of the Ten Commandments, which by its holy and righteous requirement exposed and condemned the sins of the people who came to contact God. However, by the lid of the Ark, with the propitiating blood sprinkled on it on the Day of Expiation, the entire situation on the sinner&rsquo;s side was fully covered. Therefore, upon this sin-covering lid God could meet with the people who broke His righteous law, and He could do this without, governmentally, any contradiction to His righteousness, even under the observing of the cherubim that bore His glory and overshadowed the lid of the Ark. Thus, the problem between man and God was appeased, enabling God to forgive and be merciful to man and thereby to give His grace to man. This is a prefigure of Christ as the Lamb of God taking away the sin that caused man to have a problem with God (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_29>John 1:29</a>), thus satisfying all the requirements of God&rsquo;s holiness, righteousness, and glory and appeasing the relationship between man and God. Hence, God could pass over the people&rsquo;s sins that had previously occurred. And, in order to show forth His righteousness, He had to do this. This is what this verse refers to.<br> &emsp; The Hebrew word for the lid of the Ark is kapporeth, from a root meaning to cover. In the Septuagint this word is translated hilasterion, which means the place of propitiation (implying to forgive and to give mercy&mdash;the word rendered propitious in <a href=Heb.htm#v8_12>Heb. 8:12</a> is the root of hilasterion, and the word rendered propitiated in <a href=Luk.htm#v18_13>Luke 18:13</a> is derived from this root). The King James Version adopts the rendering &ldquo;mercy seat,&rdquo; referring to the place where God grants mercy to man. In <a href=Heb.htm#v9_5>Heb. 9:5</a> Paul also used hilasterion for the lid of the Ark. Here, in <a href=Rom.htm#v3_25>Rom. 3:25</a>, the same word, hilasterion, is used to show that the lid of the Ark signifies Christ as the propitiation place set forth by God.<br> &emsp; In addition to hilasterion, two other words derived from the same Greek word as hilasterion are used in the New Testament to show how Christ took away man&rsquo;s sin to appease the relationship between man and God. One is hilaskomai (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_17>Heb. 2:17</a>), which means to propitiate, that is, to appease, to reconcile one by satisfying the other&rsquo;s demand; the other is hilasmos (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_2>1&nbsp;John 2:2</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v4_10>4:10</a>), which means that which propitiates, that is, a propitiatory sacrifice. Christ made propitiation for our sins (<a href=Heb.htm#v2_17>Heb. 2:17</a>); hence, He has become that which propitiates, the propitiatory sacrifice, between us and God (<a href=1Jo.htm#v2_2>1&nbsp;John 2:2</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v4_10>4:10</a>), and He has also become the place, as typified by the lid of the Ark (<a href=Heb.htm#v9_5>Heb. 9:5</a>), where we enjoy propitiation before God and where God gives grace to us."

Christ was crucified at the time of the Feast of the Passover (<a href=Mrk.htm#v14_12>Mark 14:12</a> and <a href=MrkN.htm#n14_12x2>note 2</a>), and then on the third day (<a href=1Co.htm#v15_4>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:4</a>), the day after the Sabbath (<a href=Lev.htm#v23_11>v. 11</a>; <a href=Joh.htm#v20_1>John 20:1</a>), He was resurrected.

Then, when we ask in prayer for whatever we will, it is not only we who are praying; He too is praying, in our praying. This kind of prayer is related to fruit-bearing (<a href=Joh.htm#v15_8>v. 8</a>) and will surely be answered. See <a href=JohN.htm#n15_16x2>note 16<sup>2</sup></a>."

BD["W),\x98"]="<b>age</b><br> &emsp; An age is a part of the world, which is the satanic system (see <a href=EphN.htm#n2_2x1>note 2<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Eph.htm#v2>Eph. 2</a>). According to the context of this book, the present evil age here refers to the religious world, the religious course of the world, the Jewish religion. This is confirmed by <a href=Gal.htm#v6_14>6:14</a>-<a href=Gal.htm#v6_15>15</a>, where circumcision is considered a part of the world&mdash;the religious world, which to the apostle Paul was crucified. Here the apostle emphasized that the purpose of Christ&rsquo;s giving Himself for our sins was to rescue us, to pluck us, out of the Jewish religion, the present evil age. This is to release God&rsquo;s chosen people from the custody of the law (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_23>3:23</a>), to bring them out of the sheepfold (<a href=Joh.htm#v10_1>John 10:1</a>, <a href=Joh.htm#v10_3>3</a>), according to the will of God. Thus, in his opening word Paul indicated what he was going to deal with: he wanted to rescue the churches, which were distracted by Judaism with its law, and bring them back to the grace of the gospel."

Although Christ has been allotted to us by God as our portion (<a href=Col.htm#v1_12>Col. 1:12</a>), if we would possess Christ and live in Christ as our land, we still need to fight against the spiritual enemies (see <a href=NumN.htm#n21_1x1>note 1<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Num.htm#v21>Num. 21</a>). We should not only pray but also fight. Actually, we are not the ones fighting, for God goes with us and fights for us. It is our duty to fight, but we cannot fulfill this duty by ourselves but only by faith in the Lord, i.e., by the Lord Himself as our life and life supply. We can fulfill the Lord&rsquo;s requirements only by the divine life, the eternal life, which is the Triune God embodied in Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_6>John 14:6</a>; <a href=1Jo.htm#v5_11>1&nbsp;John 5:11</a>-<a href=1Jo.htm#v5_12>12</a>), who is realized as the life-giving Spirit (<a href=Joh.htm#v14_16>John 14:16</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v14_20>20</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v15_45>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45</a>).
