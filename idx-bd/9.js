BD[")C=\x99"]="<b>Aaron</b><br> &emsp; The holy task of lighting the lamps was a service of holy persons, the priests, not of the common people. According to the entire Bible a priest is one who is possessed by God, filled with God, saturated with God, and living absolutely for God. Furthermore, a priest had to be clothed with priestly garments (<a href=Exo.htm#v28_2>28:2</a>), which signify Christ lived out of the priesthood. The lighting of the lamps in the Holy Place requires the service of this kind of person.<br> &emsp; The light in the Holy Place was not a natural light or a man-made light. It was a light that came from the golden lampstand, i.e., from the divine nature of Christ. To experience the genuine lighting of the lamps in the church meetings, we must have Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, as the lampstand, the divine nature as the gold, the uplifted humanity of Christ as the wick, and the Spirit of Christ as the oil with all the steps of Christ&rsquo;s process, and we must be holy people as the priests, clothed with the expression of Christ as the priestly garments."
