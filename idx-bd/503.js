But man failed to live and walk according to his conscience and fell further into wickedness (<a href=Gen.htm#v6_5>Gen. 6:5</a>). After the judgment of the flood, God ordained that man should be under human government (<a href=Gen.htm#v9_6>Gen. 9:6</a>). Man failed in this also. Then, before fulfilling His promise to Abraham concerning the blessing of the nations in his seed, Christ (<a href=Gen.htm#v12_3>Gen. 12:3</a>; <a href=Gal.htm#v3_8>Gal. 3:8</a>), God put man under the test of the law (<a href=Rom.htm#v3_20>Rom. 3:20</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v5_20>5:20</a>). Man failed this test utterly. All these failures indicate that man has fallen from God to his conscience, from his conscience to human government, and from human government to lawlessness; that is, man has fallen to the uttermost. Hence, to conduct oneself in all good conscience before God, as Paul did, was a great return to God from man&rsquo;s fall. Paul spoke this word to vindicate himself before those who accused him of being a lawless and even reckless person. In his defense he referred again to his conscience in <a href=Act.htm#v24_16>24:16</a>. This showed his high standard of morality, in contrast to the hypocrisy of the Jewish religionists and the crookedness of the Roman (Gentile) politicians.
