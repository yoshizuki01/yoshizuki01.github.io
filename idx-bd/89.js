BD["[-?\x9b"]="<b>spirit</b><br> &emsp; This word strongly indicates that man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body.

The soul is our very self (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v16_26>Matt. 16:26</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v9_25>Luke 9:25</a>), a medium between our spirit and our body, possessing self-consciousness, that we may have our personality. The body as our external part is the outer organ, possessing world-consciousness, that we may contact the material world. The body contains the soul, and the soul is the vessel that contains the spirit. In the spirit, God as the Spirit dwells; in the soul, our self dwells; and in the body, the physical senses dwell. God sanctifies us, first, by taking possession of our spirit through regeneration (<a href=Joh.htm#v3_5>John 3:5</a>-<a href=Joh.htm#v3_6>6</a>); second, by spreading Himself as the life-giving Spirit from our spirit into our soul to saturate and transform our soul (<a href=Rom.htm#v12_2>Rom. 12:2</a>; <a href=2Co.htm#v3_18>2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18</a>); and last, by enlivening our mortal body through our soul (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_11>Rom. 8:11</a>, <a href=Rom.htm#v8_13>13</a>) and transfiguring our body by His life power (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_21>Phil. 3:21</a>).
