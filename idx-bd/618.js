BD["0))\x97"]="<b>Now</b><br> &emsp; The content of 1 and 2&nbsp;Samuel is the history of Samuel, Saul, and David, which continues the history of the judges and which is a crucial part of the central line of Israel&rsquo;s history. Samuel was a Levite by birth and a Nazarite by consecration, who became a priest, a prophet, and a judge. He initiated the prophethood to replace the waning priesthood in the speaking for God, terminated the judgeship, and brought in the kingship. Saul was a king among Israel in a negative way, and David was a king in a positive way.<br> &emsp; The central thought of 1 and 2&nbsp;Samuel is that the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy needs man&rsquo;s cooperation in the principle of incarnation, as illustrated by the history of Samuel&rsquo;s mother, Hannah, of Samuel, and of David, in the positive sense, and by the history of Eli and of Saul, in the negative sense. Such a cooperation is related to the personal enjoyment of the good land, which typifies the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ (see <a href=DeuN.htm#n8_7x1>note 7<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Deu.htm#v8>Deut. 8</a>). First and 2&nbsp;Samuel, as a continuation of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, give the details concerning the enjoyment of the God-given good land. The types in these two books show us how the New Testament believers can and should enjoy Christ as their God-allotted portion (<a href=Col.htm#v1_12>Col. 1:12</a>) for the establishing of God&rsquo;s kingdom, which is the church (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_18>Matt. 16:18</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v16_19>19</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v14_17>Rom. 14:17</a>). These types indicate that our being right with God is a condition for our enjoyment of Christ. In 1 and 2&nbsp;Samuel the good land enjoyed by those who cooperated with God became the kingdom of God, in which the cooperators reigned as kings. Likewise, in our cooperation with God we need to enjoy Christ to such an extent that our enjoyment of Christ becomes the kingdom of God, in which we reign in life with Christ (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_17>Rom. 5:17</a>)."

Because God is serious about the laws governing the tabernacle, the offerings, and the Levitical work, there was the need of some experienced ones to instruct God&rsquo;s people, especially the young ones, so that they would not become careless and unconsciously offend God in their service.

If we would take possession of Christ for our enjoyment, it is not adequate for us to be spiritual and holy.

Every aspect of the flesh, whether good or evil, is an enemy of God&rsquo;s authority (<a href=Rom.htm#v8_7>Rom. 8:7</a>). Hence, God has decided to war against the flesh continually (cf. <a href=Jdg.htm#v3_13>Judg. 3:13</a>-<a href=Jdg.htm#v3_15>15</a>; <a href=Jdg.htm#v5_14>5:14</a>; <a href=Jdg.htm#v6_3>6:3</a>; <a href=Jdg.htm#v7_12>7:12</a>-<a href=Jdg.htm#v7_14>14</a>; <a href=1Sa.htm#v15_2>1&nbsp;Sam. 15:2</a>-<a href=1Sa.htm#v15_9>9</a>, <a href=1Sa.htm#v15_32>32</a>-<a href=1Sa.htm#v15_33>33</a>; <a href=1Sa.htm#v27_8>27:8</a>; <a href=1Sa.htm#v30_1>30:1</a>-<a href=1Sa.htm#v30_17>17</a>; <a href=2Sa.htm#v8_12>2&nbsp;Sam. 8:12</a>; <a href=1Ch.htm#v4_42>1&nbsp;Chron. 4:42</a>-<a href=1Ch.htm#v4_43>43</a>; <a href=Est.htm#v3_1>Esth. 3:1</a>-<a href=Est.htm#v3_6>6</a>; <a href=Est.htm#v9_7>9:7</a>-<a href=Est.htm#v9_10>10</a>) until it is blotted out (<a href=Exo.htm#v17_14>v. 14</a>)."
BD["P56\x8c"]="But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not (let him who reads understand), then let those in Judea flee to the mountains;"
BD["U))\x98"]="<b>will</b><br> &emsp; The will of God is His determination for the carrying out of His purpose. Through this will Paul was called to be an apostle of Christ. Paul&rsquo;s assertion here strengthened his apostolic position and authority."
BD[")8;\x97"]="<b>leave</b><br> &emsp; Manna was sent every morning and had to be gathered every morning (<a href=Exo.htm#v16_21>v. 21</a>). This indicates that we cannot store up the supply of Christ. The experience of Christ as our life supply must be daily, morning by morning (cf. <a href=Mat.htm#v6_34>Matt. 6:34</a>)."
BD["P49\x8c"]="And Jesus said to them, The things that are Caesar&rsquo;s render to Caesar, and the things that are God&rsquo;s to God. And they marveled greatly at Him."
BD[")7>\x97"]="<b>three</b><br> &emsp; Three days signifies resurrection (<a href=Mat.htm#v16_21>Matt. 16:21</a>; <a href=Act.htm#v10_40>Acts 10:40</a>; <a href=1Co.htm#v15_4>1&nbsp;Cor. 15:4</a>). This indicates that it was in resurrection that the people of God were separated from Egypt. Negatively, the wilderness signifies a place of wandering (<a href=Num.htm#v14_33>Num. 14:33</a>), but here it signifies, positively, a place of separation from the world. A journey of three days corresponds to baptism, which brings people out of the world through Christ&rsquo;s death and into a wilderness, a realm of separation, in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (<a href=Rom.htm#v6_3>Rom. 6:3</a>-<a href=Rom.htm#v6_5>5</a>). See notes <a href=ExoN.htm#n14_30x1>30<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Exo.htm#v14>ch. 14</a> and <a href=GenN.htm#n7_17x1>17<sup>1</sup></a> in <a href=Gen.htm#v7>Gen. 7</a>."
BD["P3<\x8c"]="And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots."
BD["O-W\x8c"]="And if you greet only your brothers, what better thing are you doing? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?"
