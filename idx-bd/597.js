BD["a/+\x97"]="<b>without</b><br> &emsp; For all the important persons in Genesis, except Melchizedek, there is a genealogy. In the divine writing, the Holy Spirit sovereignly gave no account of the beginning of Melchizedek&rsquo;s days or of the end of his life, that he might be a proper type of Christ as the eternal One, as our perpetual High Priest. This corresponds with the presentation of the Son of God in the Gospel of John. Being eternal, the Son of God has no genealogy (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_1>John 1:1</a>). But as the Son of Man, Christ does have a genealogy (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_1>Matt. 1:1</a>-<a href=Mat.htm#v1_17>17</a>; <a href=Luk.htm#v3_23>Luke 3:23</a>-<a href=Luk.htm#v3_38>38</a>)."

Trials come from the believers&rsquo; environment to prove their faith (vv. <a href=Jam.htm#v1_2>2</a>-<a href=Jam.htm#v1_3>3</a>) through suffering (vv. <a href=Jam.htm#v1_9>9</a>-<a href=Jam.htm#v1_11>11</a>). The believers should endure the trials with all joy (<a href=Jam.htm#v1_2>v. 2</a>) because of their love for the Lord, that they may receive the blessing of the crown of life."
