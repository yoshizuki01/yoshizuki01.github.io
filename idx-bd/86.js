Such a redeemed one must also be circumcised (vv. <a href=Exo.htm#v12_44>44</a>, <a href=Exo.htm#v12_48>48</a>); i.e., his natural life must be cut off through the cross (<a href=Phi.htm#v3_3>Phil. 3:3</a>; <a href=Col.htm#v2_11>Col. 2:11</a>).

BD["/,5\x97"]="<b>Ruth</b><br> &emsp; By gaining a husband and a home for a resting place, Ruth received a reward, a gain, for God&rsquo;s economy. First, she gained a redeeming husband, who typifies Christ as the redeeming Husband of the believers (<a href=Rom.htm#v7_4>Rom. 7:4</a>). Second, Ruth was redeemed by the capable Boaz from the indebtedness of her dead husband (vv. <a href=Rut.htm#v4_1>1</a>-<a href=Rut.htm#v4_9>9</a>), typifying the believers being redeemed by Christ, the almighty, omnipotent Redeemer, from the sin of their old man, their old husband.

This indicates that Ruth had an all-inclusive and all-extensive gain with the position and capacity to bring Christ into the human race. She is thus a great link in the chain that is bringing Christ to every corner of the earth. Finally, Ruth also continued the line of the God-created humanity for the incarnation of Christ (<a href=Mat.htm#v1_17>Matt. 1:17</a>). Through Boaz and Ruth the line of humanity that was for Christ&rsquo;s incarnation was prolonged.<br> &emsp; Ruth, a Gentile and even a Moabitess, was joined to God&rsquo;s holy elect and became an heir to partake of the holy inheritance through her union with the one of the holy elect who redeemed her.

The first four chapters of this book discourse comprehensively regarding the redemption accomplished by Christ&rsquo;s death, whereas the last twelve chapters speak in detail concerning the saving afforded by Christ&rsquo;s life. Before <a href=Rom.htm#v5_11>5:11</a>, Paul shows us that we are saved because we have been redeemed, justified, and reconciled to God. However, we have not yet been saved to the extent of being sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son. Redemption, justification, and reconciliation, which are accomplished outside of us by the death of Christ, redeem us objectively; sanctification, transformation, and conformation, which are accomplished within us by the working of Christ&rsquo;s life, save us subjectively. Objective redemption redeems us positionally from condemnation and eternal punishment; subjective salvation saves us dispositionally from our old man, our self, and our natural life."

BD["T,5\x98"]="<b>righteousness</b><br> &emsp; The law was God&rsquo;s temporary economy (dispensation) for man in the Old Testament, since it was added temporarily because of man&rsquo;s transgressions (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_19>Gal. 3:19</a>); the faith is God&rsquo;s eternal economy (dispensation) for man in the New Testament, because it is based on God&rsquo;s eternal plan (cf. <a href=1TiN.htm#n1_4x4>note 4<sup>4</sup></a> in <a href=1Ti.htm#v1>1&nbsp;Tim. 1</a>). In the Old Testament God dealt with man according to the law. If, according to that dispensation of God, man would have done what God commanded in the law, he would have obtained righteousness, that is, the righteousness of the law (<a href=Rom.htm#v9_31>9:31</a>), the righteousness which is out of the law (<a href=Rom.htm#v10_5>10:5</a>; <a href=Phi.htm#v3_9>Phil. 3:9</a>). In the New Testament God deals with man according to the faith. If, according to this dispensation of God, man believes in Christ, the One in whom God has ordained that man should believe (<a href=1Jo.htm#v3_23>1&nbsp;John 3:23</a>), he will obtain righteousness, that is, the righteousness of faith (<a href=Rom.htm#v4_11>v. 11</a>), the righteousness which is out of faith (<a href=Rom.htm#v9_30>9:30</a>; <a href=Rom.htm#v10_6>10:6</a>). The faith, which is ordained by God in the New Testament economy and which replaces the law of the Old Testament, did not come until the New Testament time (<a href=Gal.htm#v3_23>Gal. 3:23</a>, <a href=Gal.htm#v3_25>25</a>). This faith, which replaces the law, is objective to us. When according to this objective faith we believe subjectively in Christ, in whom God intended that we believe, we receive the righteousness of faith. This righteousness is the Christ whom we possess&mdash;whom we receive by our subjective believing according to the objective faith ordained by God&mdash;as God&rsquo;s righteousness received by us (<a href=1Co.htm#v1_30>1&nbsp;Cor. 1:30</a>)."
