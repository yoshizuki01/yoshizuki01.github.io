For this reason, the great multitude of the saved rejoice and praise with hallelujahs (vv. <a href=Rev.htm#v19_1>1</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v19_3>3</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v19_6>6</a>), and the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures join them in praising God (<a href=Rev.htm#v19_4>v. 4</a>).<br> &emsp; The reign of God, the kingdom, is related to the marriage of the Lamb, and the marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life. By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age. Then the bride, the overcoming believers, will be ready, and the kingdom of God will come. This corresponds with the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy in <a href=Mat.htm#v26_29>Matt. 26:29</a>."

For this, He created the heavens, the earth, and mankind. After the creation of the world, there are four dispensations: the dispensation of the patriarchs, from Adam to Moses (<a href=Rom.htm#v5_14>Rom. 5:14</a>); the dispensation of law, from Moses to Christ (<a href=Joh.htm#v1_17>John 1:17</a>); the dispensation of grace, from Christ&rsquo;s first coming to the restoration of all things at Christ&rsquo;s second coming (<a href=Act.htm#v3_20>Acts 3:20</a>-<a href=Act.htm#v3_21>21</a>); and the dispensation of the kingdom, from Christ&rsquo;s second coming to the end of the millennium (<a href=Rev.htm#v11_15>11:15</a>; <a href=Rev.htm#v20_4>20:4</a>, <a href=Rev.htm#v20_6>6</a>). God uses these four dispensations to perfect and complete His chosen people that they may be His eternal corporate expression for the accomplishing of His purpose. All four dispensations belong to the old heaven and old earth. Although the dispensation of the kingdom is the dispensation of restoration, it still will take place in the old heaven and old earth, because God&rsquo;s perfecting and completing work in His chosen people will not be finished until the end of that dispensation. When God finishes this work through the dispensation of the kingdom, the old heaven and old earth will pass away through fire and be renewed to become the new heaven and new earth (<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_10>2&nbsp;Pet. 3:10</a>-<a href=2Pe.htm#v3_13>13</a>), into which the New Jerusalem will come to be God&rsquo;s eternal expression."
